The financial statements have been prepared \\nin accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), as developed and approved by the \\nInternational Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB).  \\n \\nThe report of the External Auditor on th e audit of the 2020  financial statements, together with his opinion on the \\nfinancial statements, are also submitted to the WIPO Assemblies as prescribed under Regulation 8.11 and Annex \\nII of the FRR.  \\n \\nThe annual financial report, including financial statem ent discussion and analysis, is presented in this document \\nalongside the financial statements  and the  annual  statement on internal control . \\n \\n \\nFINANCIAL STATEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  \\n \\nThe following financial statement discussion and analysis includes an  overview of the Organization’s operations \\nand environment, financial objectives and strategies, risk management strategy, financial performance and financial \\nposition duri ng the year ended December 31, 2020 . This year, due to the unprecedented global impa ct of the \\nCOVID -19 pandemic, a separate overview of its effects  on the Organization ’s operations and financial results  has \\nalso been included. The discussion and analysis  has been prepared in accordance with IPSASB Recommended \\nPractice Guideline 2, and is intended to provide an explanation of the significant items, transactions, and events \\npresented in the financial statements and the factors that influenced them. This discussion and analysis is not part \\nof WIPO’ s financial statements; however  it should be read together w ith WIPO’s financial statements . \\n \\nOperations and Environment  \\n \\nWIPO is the global forum for intellectual property services, policy, information and cooperation. It is a specialized \\nagency  of the United Nations, with 193  Member States. The Organization’ s mission is to lead the development of a \\nbalanced and effective global  intellectual property ecosystem to promote  innovation and creativity fo r a better and \\nmore sustainable future . The Organization’s mandate, governing bo dies and procedures are set out in the WIPO \\nConvention  of 1967, which established WIPO . \\n \\nWIPO’s Member States determine the direction, budget and activities of the Organization through the decision -\\nmaking bodies. The main policy and decision -making bodies of WIPO are the General Assembly , the Conference  \\nand the Coordination Committee. The  General Assembly consists of States party to the WIPO Convention which \\nare members of any of the Unions administered by WIPO.  The General Assembly constituted  the Program and \\nBudget Committee to consider matters relating to program, budget, premises and finance. The Conference is \\ncomposed of the States party to the WIPO Convention whether or not they are members of any of the Unions, and \\nis, inter alia , the competent body f or adopting amendments to the Convention.  The Coordination Committee consists \\nof elected members of the Executive Committees of the Paris or the Berne Unions , or both , one -fourth of the States \\nparty to the WIPO Convention which are not members of any of th e Unions, and Switzerland, as the State on whose \\nterritory the Organization has its headquarters . \\n \\nThe General Assembly appoints the WIPO Director General upon nomination by the Coordination Committee.  The \\ncurrent Director General, Mr Daren Tang, was appointed on May 8, 2020, and began his six -year term on O ctober  1, \\n2020.  Mr Tang succeeds Mr Francis Gurry, who served as WIPO Director General from October 1, 2008. The \\nDirector General is the chief executive of the Organization. The Director General is assisted by the Se ctor Leads  \\n(consisting of the Deputy Directors General and t he Assistant Directors General) in providing  the strategic direction \\nof WIPO’s programs and in managing their  respective Sectors  to ensure the delivery of results in line with th e \\nOrganization’s strategic goals and the  Program and Budget.  \\n \\nWIPO generates mos t of its revenue from fees that  are paid by users of its intellectual property services for patents, \\ntrademarks and industrial designs. These services are provided through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), \\nMadrid and  Hague systems. In 2020 , fees from  these activities represented 94.3 per cent of the Organization’s total \\nrevenue, with PCT s ystem fees alone representing 76.6 per cent . The driver  for revenue from these fee -based  \\nservices is the international demand for intellectual property titles.  Other exte rnal factors that  may influence the \\nOrganization’s revenue from its fee -based  services include research and development investment levels, \\ntechnological confidence levels, an d exchange rate fluctuations.  \\n  '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\wipo_pub_rn2021_18e.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='WIPO ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2020  \\n \\n5 \\n Financial Objectives and Strategies  \\n \\nThe financial activities of WIPO are governed by its Financial Regulations, which are approved by the General \\nAssembly. Financial Rules are established by the Director General in accorda nce with the provisions of the Financial \\nRegulations. WIPO’s  Member States are  informed of any modification of the Financial Rules. The Financial Rules \\ngovern all the financial management activities of the Organization. Authority and responsibility for the  \\nimplementation of the Financial Regulations and Rules is delegated by the Director General to the Controller.  \\n \\nEvery two years, the Director General presents a Program and Budget to Member States for  approval. It details \\nexpected results , performance meas ures and budgetary planning for all proposed activities. The  Program and \\nBudget for the 2020/21  biennium was approved by the Assemblie s of the Member States of WIPO in October 2019 . \\nThe Program and Budget provides the planning for the biennium within the o verall strategic context of the Medium -\\nTerm Strategic Plan.  \\n \\nThe Organization uses a Results -Based Management system to ensure that resources are budgeted and utilized \\nin line with organizational results and priorities. Organizational performance is measur ed and analyzed on a regular \\nbasis through performance indicators, targets and baselines. Under this system, both the Program and Budget and \\nthe Medium -Term Strategic Plan form part of WIPO’s planning framework, along with annual work plans and \\nindividual staff objectives.  \\n \\nThe Organization manages the levels of its reserves in accordance with its Policy on Reser ves. WIPO’s reserves \\nare accounted for  as the net assets of the Organization, and serve to minimize the impact of income shortfalls and \\nmaximize the probability that the Organization can meet its obligations in the short term and maintain financial \\nstability. One core element of the policy is the mechanism for establishing the required level of reserves as a \\npercentage of the estimated biennial expenditure of the Unions administered by the Organization . The policy also \\nestablishes the principles and approval mechanism for the use of reserves fo r one -time projects for capital \\nimprovements and exceptional circumstances.  \\n \\nThe Organization manages its investments in accordance wit h its Policy on Investments. The policy states that the \\nprimary objectives of the Organization’s investment management, i n order of importance, shall be : (i) preservation \\nof capital; (ii) liquidity and (iii) within the constraints of (i) and (ii), the rate of return. The Organization aims to ach ieve \\na market rate of return whenever appropriate and possible for both operating  and core cash.  Strategic cash is to be \\ninvested over the long -term in order to achieve capital growth and thus an overall positive return over time.  \\n \\nRisk Management  \\n \\nWIPO’s Risk Management Policy sets out the Organization’s approach to managing risks and  internal controls in a \\nconsistent and business -oriented manner, in order to support the achievement of its strategic goals and expected \\nresults. It is complemented by WIPO’s Risk and Internal Control Management Manual, which covers the day -to-day \\noperatio nal details of risk and internal control management. The policy and the manual, together with the \\norganizational arrangements, the establishment of roles and responsibilities, processes and activities for the \\nmanagement of risks and internal controls repre sent WIPO’s Risk Management Framework . \\n \\nUnder the guiding principles of WIPO’s Risk Management Policy, risk management is considered an o rganization -\\nwide responsibility . Organizational level risks are identified and reviewed by WIPO’s Risk Management Group , \\nwhich is chaired by the Director General. Risk management is performed as an integral part of the Organization’s \\nResults -Based Management cycle. WIPO’s Risk Management Framework is guided  by the risk appetite noted by \\nits Member States in WIPO’s Risk App etite Statement . \\n \\nCOVID -19 Pandemic  \\n \\nThe World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the COVID -19 coronavirus a public health emergency of \\ninternational concern (PHEIC)  on January 30, 2020 . It subsequently declared the outbreak a pandemic on  March  11, \\n2020 . The pandemic became a global challenge and impacted the global economy in an unprecedented manner. \\nIn its 2019 f inancial statements, WIPO disclosed the outbreak as a non -adjusting event after the reporting date, in \\naccordance with IPSAS 14. This disclosure stated that , given the global effects of the pandemic, there would  be \\nsignificant impacts on the Organization’s operations in 2020, the extent of which could not reliably  be estimated at \\nthat time.  While the eventual impact  on the  way WIPO  condu cted its business  in 2020  was profound, the direct, \\nvisible and measurable impact on the financial performance for 2020 and the financial position at the end of the \\nyear was  more limited. Although  there can be no objective  or exact method of  determin ing the complete  impact of \\nthe COVID -19 pandemic on these financial statements, certain broad trends can be identified and are reflected in \\nthe following summary of the effects of the  pandemic on WIPO’s operation s and financial results.  \\n \\nOn March 1 7, 2020, WIPO  premises  at its headquarters in Geneva  were closed  in the face of the evolving health \\ncrisis and lockdown decisions mad e by the Host Government. Physical access to WIPO  was limited to  a smal l \\ncritical presence needed to perform essential services  on premi ses; all other staff continued to work remotely . The '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\wipo_pub_rn2021_18e.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='WIPO ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2020  \\n \\n6 \\n Organization already had in place a Business Continuity Plan that addressed the threat of significant disruption to \\ncritical functions, and was  quickly  able to adjust  to these unprecedent ed circumstances . During the initial phase of \\nthe crisis, staff were provided laptops and other equipment to permit them to connect to WIPO systems safely from \\nremote locations. WIPO servi ces, including fee -based  and support services , rapidly attained  near-optimal capacit y. \\nWith the gradual decline of infection rates in the Geneva region, and the scaling back of lockdown measures by the \\nHost Government, WIPO initiated a carefully planned and phased return -to-premises program in June 2020. \\nHowever , in October 2020 the epide miolog ical situation  in Geneva  rapidly deteriorated as the second wave of the \\nCOVID -19 pandemic gripped most of the world.  This culminated in the Host Government issuing a new series of \\nrecommendations , including for employers to implement remote working as much as possible. As of November 2, \\n2020, all WIPO personnel, except those required to be on -site, resumed remote working.  \\n \\nThe Organization monitored its directly related COVID -19 expenditure during 2020 , which totaled approximately 3.6 \\nmillio n Swiss francs. This concerned  principally  expenditure on IT equipment and IT services  to meet remote \\nworking and virtual or hybrid meeting requirements. Other expenditure considered directly related to the impacts of \\nCOVID -19 on the Organization’s operati ons included  cleaning and disinfection products, furniture and equipment \\nfor new layout requirements, purchase of medical supplies , additional medical staff,  and lunch allowances.  Travel \\nbans and restrictions  during 2020  had a significant  impact  on WIPO’s activities involving traditional, in -person \\nimplementation modalities, especially in the  areas of capacity building and support services . This required the \\nOrganization to  adapt  its delivery methods in order to respond to the constraints cause d by the pandemic. In financial \\nterms, the cost of missions for staff and consultants fell from 5.7 million Swiss francs in 2019, to 0.5 million Swiss \\nfrancs in 2020. Official meetings and conferences moved to hybrid and virtual modes  during the year. The \\nOrganization’s third party travel costs, including participants and lecturers, fell from 10.5 m illion Swiss francs in 2019 \\nto 0.5 million Swiss francs in 2020.   \\n \\nWIPO’s revenue from fees charged for applications under  the PCT, Madrid and Hague system s is recognized at \\nthe date of publication  of the application, in accordance with the requirements of IPSAS. As publication takes place \\nsome time after the filing of an application, reven ue levels from these systems do  not necessarily  provide  an \\nimmediate indicat ion of the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic for the Organization. Looking more specifically at \\nfilings of applications in 2020, overall  demand for WIPO’s fee -based  services under its intellectual property  systems \\nremained  strong  considering the unprecedente d circumstances . Revenue from the PCT system , based on \\npublications of PCT applications  in the year,  was 6.1  per cent higher than in 2019 , totaling 3 58.6 million  Swiss \\nfrancs . PCT application filings also grew in 2020, reaching an estimated 275,900 applications, a record figure and \\na 4.0 per cent increase on the 2019 number of 265,381.  Revenue from the Madrid system, again  recognized at the \\ndate of publication of the application, fell by 0.8 per cent compared to 2019, totaling 76.2 million Swiss fran cs. Use \\nof the M adrid system also slightly  decrease d in 2020 . International trademark applications totaled  an estimated \\n63,800, down by 0.6 per cent on the 2019 number of 64,168, representing  the first decline since the global financial \\ncrisis of 2008 -2009 . This was expected, given that trademarks tend to represent the introduction of new goods and \\nservices, both of which slowed as a result of the global pandemic.  The economic fallout from the pandemic also hit \\ndemand for the protection of industrial design s via the Hague system. Applications fell by 1.7 per cent, and designs \\nin those applications dropped by 15.0 per cent. Revenue from the Hague system  in 2020 actually increased from \\n5.3 million Swiss francs in 2019 to 6.7 million Swiss francs  as registratio n publication volumes increased over the \\nyear. The reduced demand for the Hague system seen in 2020 may be expected to impact revenue in 2021.   \\n \\nConcerning the Organization’s assets, as at each year end and in  accordance  with the requirements of IPSAS , \\nWIPO performed its annual impairment reviews to ensure that assets were recorded at an appropriate value in the \\nfinancial statements. This exercise did not indicate any im pairment attributable to the impacts of the COVID -19 \\npandemic.  The review of financial i nstruments in cluding accounts receivable, revealed  no impact on payment \\npatterns that would require recognition of credit loss.  Although the Organization’s buildings  were  utilized to a much \\nlower extent in 2020 than in 2019, no impairment was considered ne cessary for these long -term assets. For the \\nOrganization’s liabilities, the most noticeable consequence of the pandemic was an increase of 5.8 million Swiss \\nfrancs in the accumulated annual leave liability,  largely due to the impact of staff not taking the ir planned leave \\nentitlements in 2020 as a result of travel limitations.  Due to these limitations, as an exceptional measure for  2020 , \\nthe Organization increased the maximum annual accrual and carry -forward balance for annual leave.  \\n \\nAt the end of 2020, the Organization achieved  investment  gains of 33. 4 million Swiss francs. Global f inancial \\nmarkets reacted strongly to the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic in February and March  2020 .

The A SHI \\nliability increased by 1 39.1 million Swiss francs compared to the 201 9 balance . The calculation of the  ASHI liability \\nis performed by an independent actuary . In accordance with IPSAS requirements, the ASHI liability recognized in \\nthe financial statements represents the present value of all expected future benefits to existing retirees and their \\ndependents, and all accrued post -employment benefits of active staff. On average, medical costs increase with age, \\nso the most significant expected medical costs remain to be paid in the future. To manage the cost and risk of its \\ncollective medical insurance plan, WIPO has secured an insurance contract that allows a level pe r person premium \\nto be paid for existing retirees and active staff, thus reducing the cash paid on behalf of older retirees relative to \\ntheir incurred medical  cost.    \\n \\nThe ASHI liability calculation  incorporates a number of actuarial assumptions. These in clude the discount  rate, \\nmedical cost trend rates,  age-grading for medical claims,  retirement  rates a nd mortality rates. Changes to these \\nassumptions year on year lead to actuarial gains and losses which are recognized as part of the liability in the \\nState ment of Financial Position.  A breakdown of the movement in the liability due to actuarial gains and losses is \\nprovided in Note 10 of these financial statements.  The increase in the liability in 2020 was mainly due to a \\nmodification of the expected future a ge-related medical costs. The ASHI liability is the ultimate cost of providing \\nfuture post -employment medical costs, derived from the medical insurance premiums by applying an age -specific \\ngrading factor based on an  analysis of recent claims data which  has led to changes and increases at certain age \\ngroups . This is different from considering only the medical insurance premiums , which are mitigated by  lower \\nexpected costs for the younger staff and new joiners . \\n \\nOther changes to actuarial assumptions incl uded a  further lowering of  the discount rate from 0.50  per cent to 0.30 \\nper cent , which  also led to an increase in the liability . This was partly offset by a decrease in the medical cost trend \\nrate from  3.00 per cent to 2.90 per cent.  The following graph s hows how the ASHI liability has  developed since \\n2016 , and includes actuarial forecasts for 20 21-2024 (applying the same assumptions as for the 2020  calculation). \\nThe graph also shows how discount rates and medical cost tre nd rates have changed since 2016 :  \\n \\n  '),\n",

The projected increase in \\nthe liability for 2021 -2024 reflects the demographic make -up of participants in WIPO’s collective medical insurance \\nplan.

The Organization gene rally holds \\nits cash deposits in instant a ccess bank accounts. During 2020  the Organization continued to hold balances in term \\ndeposit accounts (for periods up to 12 months). This has allowed the Organization to reduce the level of  charges \\non certain insta nt access bank accounts following the introduction of negative interest rates during 201 5. \\n \\nAs at December 3 1, 2020 , WIPO’s medium -term investment portfolio (core cash invest ments) had a fair value of \\n471.7  million Swiss francs, and the long -term investmen t portfolio (strategic cash investments) had a fair valu e of \\n200.6 million Swiss francs . WIPO’s non -current investments are held at fair value in the Statement of  Financial \\nPosition. Fair value increases in these  investment portfolio assets during 2020, as  noted above,  reflect short term \\nmarket volatility.

The aim of this system of internal control is to manage risk to a tolerable \\nlevel rather than to eliminate it entirely. As such, it sets out to provide reasonable assurance over the:  \\n \\nReliability of financial reporting – transactions authorized and properly recorded and material errors or irregularities \\nare either prevented or detected in a timely manner;  \\nEffectiveness and efficiency of processes, the safeguarding of  assets and the exercise of econ omy;  and \\nCompliance with WIPO’s regulatory framework and any other applicable rules and  regulations.  \\n \\nThis Statement is presented in line with the seven components of WIPO’s Accountability Framework \\n(WO/PBC/29/4), which itself is aligned to the COSO framew ork and Three Lines Model.  \\n \\nMy current statement on WIPO’s internal control processes, as described above, applies for the year ended \\nDecember 31, 2020, and up to the date of the approval of the Organization’s 2020 financial statements.  \\n \\n1. Results based plan ning  \\n \\nResource needs are driven  by the substantive work program planned for implementation during a biennium, in \\naccordance with the Medium Term Strategic Plan (MTSP).  Member States’ approval of the 2020/21 Program and \\nBudget sets the implementation parameters for the biennium, and con trol processes centered on the WIPO FRRs \\nensure that WIPO Programs are implemented in accordance with those approvals.  \\n \\nAnnual workplanning, implementation and monitoring are controlled via a suite of enterprise resource management \\ntools and appropriate wo rk processes throughout the biennium.  \\n \\n2. Performance and risk management  \\n \\nThe year represented a period of significant uncertainty and disruption globally.  In order to provide assurance \\npublicly, WIPO published monthly crisis management dashboards on its website. Despite the disruptions, income \\nwas higher than forecasted, and this demonstrates to some extent, the resilien ce of the global IP ecosystem.  At \\nthe organizational level, I chaired the Crisis Management Team and the Risk Management Group. These structures \\nwork together to manage the Organization’s overall risk portfolio as outlined in the WIPO Risk Appetite Statem ent, \\nin the context of the global health and economic crisis.  Critical risks and appropriate responses were reviewed \\nregularly. These include the following key risks that we faced in 2020 and beyond:  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Program Delivery Risk  \\n \\nThe Covid -19 pandemic and the restrictions related to on -site presence, travel and meetings placed severe pressure \\non some Programs to deliver planned activities.   \\n '),\n",

However, those of WIPO’s Programs that \\nare largely dependent on traditional, in -person implementation modalities for the holding of meetings and capacity \\nbuilding events continued to be signif icantly impacted by the pandemic. These Programs have adapted their content \\nand delivery methods in order to respond to the temporary constraints caused by the pandemic.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Financial Risk  \\n \\nParticularly in light of the Covid -19 situation, the risk that revenu e would be lower than initially forecast, or that the \\nvalue of some investments made under the investment strategies for operating, core and strategic cash pools could \\ndecrease, was exacerbated.   \\n \\nControl and mitigation:  Filing numbers continued to remai n resilient throughout 2020 with the Organizational income \\ncorrespondingly strong.  There was a significant planned ‘buffer’ between forecast revenue and planned \\nexpenditure.  Investments continued to be under close review and oversight by the Advisory Com mittee on \\nInvestments with the assistance of independent investment advisors throughout the year and through monthly \\nreporting to the IAOC.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Cyber Risk  \\n \\nWIPO is exposed to the risk of cyber -attacks, potentially more so during remote working modalities, an d the risk of \\nmalicious or accidental breach of data leading to unauthorized disclosure or misuse of WIPO’s confidential \\ninformation, or disruption of business operations remained.  \\n \\nControl and mitigation:  WIPO continues to implement a number of phased fit -for-purpose information assurance \\nstrategies across governance, people, processes and technologies, to strengthen its information security posture \\nand its resilience against evolvi ng cyber security threats.   \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Strategic Risk  \\n \\nRisk that WIPO’s Global IP services fail to keep pace and remain the best value option for IP protection, or the \\nperceived value of IP protection declines, in the context of a rapidly changed global economic, political and \\ntechnological landscape, including from the Covid -19 pandemic.  \\n \\nControl and mitigation: WIPO will engage and communicate more effectively around the world on IP and connect it \\nmore clearly to the improvement of lives and livelihoods, and more  broadly, to its power as a tool to catalyze \\neconomic and societal benefits. To ensure that our services continue to bring value to users, we will continue to \\nscan, understand and use emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, block chain, digi tal time stamping \\nand digital media in improving our services.  \\n \\n3. Monitoring, Oversight, Complaints and Response Mechanisms  \\n \\nAs Director General of WIPO, I am ultimately accountable for the effectiveness of the system of internal controls.  \\nMy assertion is s upported and informed by:  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 A statement on internal control from the former Director General, referring to the period January 1 to Septem ber \\n30, 2020 which has been reviewed by me and the Risk Management Group and is supported by Management \\nRepresentation Letters (MRL);  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The Deputy Directors General and Assistant Directors General in office in 2020, who have signed MRLs from \\nwhich I derive assurance.  These letters recognize their responsibility for having and maintaining, in the Sectors \\nfor which they were  responsible, well -functioning systems and a mechanism for internal control aimed at \\npreventing and/or detecting instances of fraud and major  errors;  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The Risk Management Group (RMG) whose purpose is to promote a culture of responsible risk management \\nin WIPO and reviews and monitors WIPO’s financial situation, the key risks to the achievement of Expected \\nResults and this present Statement together with the evidence that supports it;  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The Chief Ethics Officer, who is accountable for ensuring the design, de velopment and implementation of an \\neffective Ethics program to enhance integrity, compliance with ethics rules, and the ethical conduct of the \\nOrganization’s business. WIPO’s Code of Ethics, and policies on Financial Disclosure and Declaration of \\nInterests , Protect Against Retaliation for Reporting Misconduct and for Cooperating with Duly Authorized Audits \\nor Investigations further contribute to setting the right tone in this area;  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The Internal Oversight Division (IOD), on whose assurance and advisory serv ices I rely, through reports of \\ninternal audit and evaluation as well as management implication reports resulting from investigations.  These \\nreports include recommendations, independent and objective observations on the efficiency and effectiveness '),\n",

Its mandate includes the promotion of internal controls, \\nreviewing the effectiveness and operational independence of the internal oversight function, and reviewing and \\nadvising on the ethics function;  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The Joint Inspection Unit of the United Nations  System, which is mandated to conduct evaluations, inspections \\nand investigations system -wide;  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The External Auditor, whose audit aims to provide independent assurance to Member States, to add value to \\nWIPO's financial management and governance, and to support its objectives through the external audit \\nprocess;  and \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The Governing Bodies’  observations . \\n \\nI further ensure that Feedback Mechanisms are in place for Member States, Customer Complaint Resolution \\nServices are in place for clients and that Informal and Formal Conflict Resolution Mechanisms are in place for staff.  \\n \\n4. Control Activities  \\n \\nOver 380 P rocess Level Controls are management controls that ensure the effective and efficient functioning of \\nend-to-end business processes and the compliance with the Organization’s regulatory framework.  These controls \\nare assessed annually for strength, in parti cular their maturity, automation and level of documented evidence.  The \\nresults are reported to the RMG and the IAOC in the WIPO Assurance Summary.   \\n \\nDuring 2020 , the Organization largely moved to a virtual working environment as a result of the Covid pan demic.  \\nControl activities continued to be undertaken in the virtual environment as previously, ensuring the robust control \\nenvironment was maintained.  However, over the course of the year, some controls were digitalized or otherwise \\nmodified, for example , electronic signatures in place of hand written authorization. We continued to make \\nimprovements the system of assurance including the development of a strategy that defines the increased use of \\ndata analytics for internal controls  as well as an increased  identification of internal controls in the areas of \\nInformation Security, Information Technology, Enterprise Solutions, and Staff Development.  Looking forward, we \\nanticipate initiating implementation of the above strategy and a focus on control assessmen ts for External Offices.  \\n \\n5. Information and Communication  \\n \\nThe RMG is kept  informed of risks and controls through access to our business intelligence system.  Quarterly risk \\nreports and annual risk management reports take stock of the evolving situation periodically.  External specialist \\nrisk intelligence provides independent ad vice to ensure a comprehensive view, and internally, an annual survey to \\nsenior staff tests their level of confidence in accountability systems at W IPO. \\n \\nA robust Information and Data Governance Framework is in place reflecting its importance to WIPO.   A Master Data \\nManagement Policy provides a directive control for managing critical data and provides a n authorit ative point of \\nreference for integration  into the enterprise architecture.  An information classification and handling policy provides \\na preventive  control raising understanding and application of levels of information confidentiality.  \\n \\nThe portfolio of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solutions provide a high level of control, including transactional \\nlevel system controls and data analytics.  The Enterprise Risk Management solution ensures controls are \\nsystematically owned, assessed and as appropriate linked to risks.   The annual WIPO Performance Report \\npresented to Member States includes a review of the evolution and impact of risks on the deliver y of Expected \\nResults for each Program.  \\n \\n6. Ethical Standards and Integrity  \\n \\nThe conduct and actions of WIPO staff must always adhere to the highest ethical standards, as set out in the WIPO \\nCode of Ethics.   Ethics training is provided to all staff through th e Ethics Office and fraud awareness training  has \\nbeen completed by over 96 per cent of staff.  \\n \\nWIPO has in place Organization -wide anti -fraud controls, in accordance with good practices and applicable \\ninternational standards, based on risk assessments.   Appropriate fraud prevention, detection, response and data \\ncollection procedures and processes exist in the Organization, reflecting WIPO’s comprehensive anti -fraud \\ngovernance framework.  \\n \"),\n",

WIPO’s procurement policy and procedures include a rob ust delegation \\nmodel for procurement authority as well as additional controls and reporting.  A Vendor Sanctions policy and a Code \\nof Conduct for Staff Involved in Procurement actions represent important control processes.   \\n \\nWIPO’s Core Values are express ed as “Shaping the Future”, “Acting Responsibly”, “Delivering Excellence” and \\n“Working as One”, and all contribute to fostering a culture of accountability and strong ethical values.  \\n \\nConclusion  \\n \\nBased on the contents of this statement and the evidence tha t underpins it, I conclude that, to the best of my \\nknowledge and information, there have been no material weaknesses that would affect the reliability of the \\nOrganization’s financial statements, nor are there significant matters arising which would need to  be raised in the \\npresent document for the period covered.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Daren Tang  \\n Director General  \\n \\n June 18, 2021  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n'),\n",

WIPO was recognized as a specialized agency of the United Nations  in 1974 . WIPO is \\nbased in Geneva, Switzerland , and enjoys privile ges and immunities as granted under the 1947 Convention on  the \\nPrivileges and Immunities of  the Specialized Agencies of the United Nations and the 1970 Headquarters Agreement \\nwith the Swiss Federal  Council, notably being exempt from paying most forms of di rect and indirect taxation.  WIPO \\nalso has external offices in Abuja, Algiers, Beijing, Moscow, Rio de Janeiro, Singapore and Tokyo, along with a \\ncoordination office in New York.  \\n \\nWIPO  promot es innovation and creativity for the economic, social and cultural  development of all countries, through \\na balanced and effective international intellectual property system. WIPO’s broad -ranging activities include the \\nfollowing  main areas of work: providing intellectual property services through the Organization’s Global  IP \\nsystems;   developing and maintaining th e technical infrastructure that  not only supports the international IP system, \\nbut also provides access to its outputs, enhances data flows, and enables global cooperation;   serving as a \\nmultilateral forum for dis cussions on the normative development of intellectual property policy;   and facilitating the \\nuse of IP for social, cultural and economic development, by mainstreaming development considerations and \\ndelivering development cooperation activities horizontally  across all of the Organization’s programs . \\n \\nWIPO is funded from fees derived from services provided by the Organization, assessed contributions paid by its \\nMember States , and voluntary contributions from Member States and other donors. The Organization op erates \\nwithin the framework of a biennial program and budget which provides the appropriations that constitute the \\nbudgetary expenditure authorizations approved by the Assemblies for the  financial period. The approval of the \\nappropriations provides the authority for the Director General to commit and authorize expenses and to make \\npayments for the purposes assigned within the limits of the appropriations . \\n \\n \\nNote 2: Significant Accounting Policies  \\n \\nBasis of Preparation  \\n \\nThese  financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and comply with International Public Sector \\nAccounting Standards (IPSAS). The financial statements are presented in Swiss francs, which is the reporting and \\nfunctional currency of WIPO, and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand. The accounting policies have \\nbeen applied consistently to all years presented . \\n \\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost , unless stated otherw ise. The Statement \\nof Cash F low is prepared using the indirect method. The financial statements are prepared on an accrual and going -\\nconcern basis.  \\n \\nIPSAS 42 Social Benefits , was published in January 2019 with an original implementation date of January 1, 2022.  \\nThis implementation date has now been deferred to January 1, 2023 due to the COVID -19 pandemic and the \\nchallenges it has created. It is not expected that this standard will impact the Organization’s financial statements . \\n \\nCash and Cash Equivalents  \\n \\nCash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, deposits held up to 90 days and \\nother short -term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash and subject to insignificant risk of \\nchanges in value . \\n \\nInvestments  \\n \\nInvestments are classified as current or non -current assets according to the time horizon of the investment \\nobjectives. If the time horizon is less than or equal to one year, they are classified as current assets, and if it is more \\nthan one ye ar, they are classified as non -current assets . \\n \\nForeign Currency Transactions  \\n \\nThe functional currency of WIPO is the Swiss franc. All transactions occurring in other currencies are translated into \\nSwiss francs using the United Nations Operational Rates of  Exchange (UNORE) which represent those prevailing \\nat the date of the transactions. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such \\ntransactions and from the translation at the reporting date of assets and liabilities de nominated in currencies other \\nthan WIPO’s functional currency are recognized in the Statement of Financial Performance .

Revenue \\nfrom fees received for applications n ot published at the reporting date is deferred until publication has been \\ncompleted. The portion of the PCT application fee covering the costs of translation of non -English language \\npatentability reports received after publication is also deferred until th e translation is completed. All other fees under \\nthe PCT, Madrid and Hague systems are recognized when the services covered by the fee have been provided. \\nRevenue from publications  is recognized upon full delivery of the goods.  Revenue from  Arbitration and  Mediation \\nservices is recognized upon delivery of the  services  related to the submission of a request covered by the fee \\nreceived . \\n \\nRevenue from non -exchange transactions such as voluntary contributions to Special Accounts supported by \\nenforceable agreeme nts is recognized as revenue at the time the agreement becomes binding unless the \\nagreement includes conditions related to specific performance or the return of unexpended balances. Such \\nagreements require initial recognition of a liability to defer revenu e recognition and then revenue is recognized as \\nthe liability is discharged through performance of the specific conditions included in the agreement.  \\n \\nAssessed contributions are recognized as revenue at the beginning of each year of the budget period to wh ich the \\nassessment relates.  \\n \\nExpense Recognition  \\n \\nExpenses are recognized as goods are received and as services are delivered.  \\n \\nReceivables  \\n \\nReceivables from exchange transactions include fees which are charged to users of WIPO’s intellectual property \\nservices through the PCT, Madrid and Hague systems. These are measured at the fair value of the consideration \\nreceivable for PCT, Madrid and Hague system fees once the international application has been filed . \\n \\nReceivables from non -exchange transactions includ e uncollected assessed contributions. These are measured at \\nthe fair value of the consideration receivable. An allowance for non -recoverable receivables is recorded equal to \\nthe assessed contributions frozen by action of the General Assembly in 1989 and 19 91, plus contributions \\nreceivable from Member States that have lost the right to vote in accordance with Article 11, paragraph 5 of the \\nWIPO Convention . \\n \\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment  \\n \\nEquipment is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Equipment is recognized a s an asset \\nif it has a cost of 10 ,000 Swiss francs or more per unit. Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing \\nthe proceeds with the carrying amount of the asset and are included in the Statement of Financial Performance. \\nHeritage assets including donated works of art are not valued in the financial statements . \\n \\nLand is carried at fair value as determined by an independent valuation in accordanc e with International Valuation \\nStandards. Changes in fair value are recognized directly in net assets through the Revaluation Reserve Surplus. \\nBuildings and constructions in use are valued at the cost of construction when new plus the cost of subsequent \\nimprovements, less accumulated depreciation. For the initial recognition of buildings in use as at January 1, 2010, \\nthe date of transition to IPSAS, the value when new was determined by reference to a deemed cost calculated by \\nan external consultant and repr esenting the value of each component at construction plus improvements existing \\nat the initial recognition, less accumulated depreciation based upon the remaining useful life of each component. \\nSubsequent costs of major renovations and improvements to buil dings and constructions that increase or extend \\nthe future economic benefits or service potential are valued at cost.  \\n \\nDepreciation is charged so as to write off the full cost of property, plant, and equipment over its estimated useful \\nlife using the strai ght-line method. Where property, plant, and equipment is only in use for part of the year (due to \\nacquisition, disposal or retirement during the year), depreciation is charged only for the months during which the \\nasset was in use.

If such an indication exists, the \\nrecoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment loss, if any. Any \\nimpairment loss is recognized in the Statement of Financial Performance . \\n \\nIntangible Assets  \\n \\nIntangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Amortization is provided on a \\nstraight -line basis on all intangible assets of finite life, at rates that will write off the cost or value of the assets o ver \\ntheir useful lives. The useful lives of major classes of intangible assets have been estimated as follows : \\n \\nClass Estimated useful life\\nSoftware externally acquired 5 years\\nSoftware internally developed 5 years\\nLicenses and rights Period of licence/right\\n \\nAcquired computer software licenses are capitalized based on costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific \\nsoftware. Software or sof tware licenses purchased externally are recognized as an asset if they have a cost of \\n20,000 Swiss francs or more per unit. Costs that are directly associated with the internal development of software \\nfor use by WIPO are capitalized as intangible assets on ly if the recognition criteria under IPSAS 31 are met. Direct \\ncosts include the software development employee costs.  \\n \\nThe rights to use property in the Canton of Geneva acquired by the Organization through purchase have been \\nrecognized at historic cost and  are amortized over the remaining period of the grant.  The rights to use property \\ngranted by the Canton of Geneva acquired without cost, that revert back to the Canton at the end of the grant, are \\nnot valued in the financial statements . \\n \\nFinancial Assets  \\n \\nFinancial assets  are recognized initially at fair value, normally being the transaction price. The subsequent \\nmeasurement of financial assets depends on their classification. WIPO classifies its financial assets as either \\nmeasured at amortized cost or mea sured at fair value through surplus or deficit. The classification depends on \\nWIPO’s management model for the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial \\nassets. WIPO assesses on a forward looking basis the expected cred it losses associated with its financial assets \\nclassified as measured at amortized cost.  \\n \\n \\n '),\n",

After initial recognition, financial liabilities are \\nsubsequently measure d at amortized cost.  \\n \\nDerivative Financial Instruments  \\n \\nWIPO uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency risks. \\nThese financial instruments are initially recognized  at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is \\nentered into and are subsequently re -measured at fair value . \\n \\nEmployee Benefits  \\n \\nLiabilities are established for After -Service Health Insurance (ASHI), repatriation grants and travel , and long-term \\naccumulated annual leave  as determined by an independent actuary on an annual basis utilizing the projected unit \\ncredit methodology of valuation. For the ASHI liability , actuarial gains and losses are recognized in net assets . In \\naddition, liabil ities are established for the value of short -term accumulated  annual  leave, home leave not taken, \\novertime earned but unpaid, separation benefits, performance rewards , and for education grants payable at the \\nreporting date that have not been included in cu rrent expenditure . \\n \\nWIPO is a member organization participating in the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund ( the Fund ), which was \\nestablished by the United Nations General Assembly to provide retirement, death, disability and related ben efits to \\nemploye es. The Fund is a funded, multi -employer defined benefit plan. As specified by Article 3(b) of the \\nRegulations of the Fund, membership in the Fund shall be open to the specialized agencies and to any other \\ninternational, intergovernmental organization whic h participates in the common system of salaries, allowances and \\nother conditions of service of the United Nations and the specialized agencies . \\n \\nThe Fund  exposes participating organizations to actuarial risks associated with the current and former employee s \\nof other organizations participating in the Fund, with the result that there is no consistent and reliable basis for \\nallocating the obligation, plan assets, and costs to individual organizations participating in the Fund . WIPO and the \\nFund , in line with the other participating organizations in the Fund, are not in a position to identify WIPO’s \\nproportionate share of the defined benefit obligation, the plan assets and the costs associated with the plan with \\nsufficient reliability for accounting purposes. H ence WIPO has treated this plan as if it were a defined contribution \\nplan in line with the requirements of IPSAS 39 Employee Benefits . WIPO’s contributions to the Fund  during the \\nfinancial period are  recognized as expenses in the Statement of Financial P erformance . \\n \\nLeases  \\n \\nFinance leases are recogniz ed as assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position at the lower of the fair \\nvalue of the leased item or the present value of the minimum lease payments at the commencement of the lease \\nterm. Th e finance charge is charged to surplus or deficit over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic \\nrate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. The amount recogniz ed as an asset is depreciated over its \\nuseful life.  \\n \\nOperating l ease  payments are recogniz ed as an expense on a straight -line basis over the lease term.  \\n \\nProvisions  \\n \\nProvisions are recognized when the Organization has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, \\nwhereby it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and where a reliable \\nestimate of the amount of the obligation can be made . \\n \\nNet Assets  \\n \\nThe Organization’s net assets represent the balance of its reserves, which include its Reserves (Accumulated \\nSurpluses, Special Projects Reserve and Revaluation Reserve Surplus) and Working Capital Funds. The \\nOrganization also recognizes actuarial gains and losses directly through net assets. The Organization manages the \\nlevel of its reserves in accordance with i ts Policy on Reserves . \\n \\nThe Accumulated Surpluses of the Organization represent the accumulated net result of operations in the reporting \\nyear and prior periods after the impact of IPSAS.  WIPO’s Policy on Reserves establishes the principles and approval \\nmechanism for the use of reserves for one -time projects for capital improvements and exceptional circumstances. \\nThe Special Projects Reserve contains the appropriations to these projects financed from reserves, less \\naccumulated expenditure . The Revaluation  Reserve Surplus includes the cumulative results of revaluations of the \\nland owned by the Organization on which the New Building has been constructed .

The Working Capital \\nFunds are financed by contributions and are held in trust by WIPO for the Member States of the respective  Unions.  \\n \\nSegment Reporting  \\n \\nSegment reporting is based upon the Unions that form WIPO. Revenue and expenses incurred by the Organization \\nare allocated among the Unions in accordance with an allocation methodology approved by the WIPO A ssembly \\n(Program and  Budget 2020/21 , Annex III ). The methodology allocates revenue and expenses to each program and \\nthen to each Union based on a combination of direct revenue and expense, staff head count and each Union’s \\n“capacity  to pay ”. Direct Union expenses are allocate d to Unions either fully or on the basis of estimates by Program \\nManagers. Direct administrative expenses are allocated to the Unions based on relative headcount shares. Indirect \\nUnion expenses and indirect administrative expenses are allocated to the Unio ns based on the “capacity -to-pay” \\nprinciple. If the Union has a reserve level above its reserve target, it is deemed to be able to support indirect \\nactivities. The “capacity to pay” is calculated as the difference between a Union’s projected biennial incom e and its \\ndirect Union and direct administrative expenses. The extent to which this support can be provided by each Union is \\ncalculated by considering the relative extent to which the Union’s income exceeds its direct expenditure.  The only \\ninter-segment ch arge represents the costs of program support incurred by the Unions in support of Special \\nAccounts. Program support costs are charged to the Special Accounts based on a percentage of total direct \\nexpenditure specified in the agreement with the donor making  the voluntary contribution. WIPO’s assets and \\nliabilities are not allocated to individual segments, since ownership rests with the Organization as a whole, however, \\neach Union’s share of the Organization’s net assets including Reserves and Working Capital  Funds is re cognized \\nby segment.  \\n \\nChanges in Presentation  \\n \\nIn the Statement of Financial Position the basis for allocating long -term employee benefit liabilities between current \\nand non -current liabilities has been modified. Previously the current allocati on was based on the expected expense \\nin the following twelve months, and this has been changed to reflect the amounts expected to be settled in the \\nfollowing twelve months . This  modification results in a  presentation of the current portion  of benefits incl uded in  the \\nbenefit obligation as it stands at the reporting date. As a result of this change, 24.2 million Swiss francs has been \\nreallocated from current to non -current employee benefits in the 2019 comparative numbers in the Statement of \\nFinancial Positi on. \\n \\nUse of Estimates  \\n \\nThe financial statements necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. \\nEstimates include, b ut are not limited to: ASHI, repatriation grants and travel , and long -term accumulated annual \\nleave  liabilities (the value of which are calculated by an independent actuary), other employee benefit liabilities, \\nprovisions for litigation, financial risk on accounts receivable, accrued charges and the degree of impairment of \\nfixed assets.

Staff in posts  may normally  accrue up to 15 days \\nof annual leave in a given year, and a total accu mulated balance of 60 days.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing, due to \\nthe COVID -19 pandemic exceptional measures were introduced to allow the accrual of up to 20 days annual leave \\nin 2020, and a total accumulated balance of 80 days to be carried forward to 202 1. On separation from service, \\nstaff in posts who have accumulated annual leave can receive a payment in lieu of an amount equivalent to their \\nsalary for the period of accumulated annual leave, up to a maximum of 60 days.  \\n \\nEmployee benefit liabilities for ASHI, repatriation grant and travel, and accumulated leave (posts) are calculated by \\nan independent actuary.

Consistent with the approach taken in 2019, in the \\n2020 actuar ial calculation age -grading factors have been applied to premiums to derive the expected future \\nunderlying medical claims costs for active staff, retirees and dependents. The 2020 age -grading factors were based \\non an analysis of claims data over a four -year period which led to changes in the factors compared to those applied \\nin the prior year. No specific modifications were made to any of the 2020 actuarial assumptions, including those \\nrelated to medical claims or mortality rates, as a result of  the COVID -19 pandemic. Currently there is insufficient \\navailable information to understand the long -term effects of COVID -19 on these future trends . Contributions paid \\nby the O rganization for ASHI totaled 3.9 million Swiss francs for 2020 (3.7  million  Swiss francs in  2019 ). Expected \\ncontributions to ASHI in 20 21 are 4.9 million  Swiss francs. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit \\nobligation as at December 31, 2020, was 23 years. The  following table details the present value of the defined \\nbenefit obligation and experience adjustments  on the ASHI liability for 2020 and the previous four years : \\n \\n2020 2019 2018 2017 2016\\nDefined benefit obligation 452,755 313,694 303,128 304,376 320,888\\nExperience (gain)/loss adjustments on plan liability 2,400 -37,983 -3,092 -17,122 3,377(in thousands of Swiss francs)\\n \\nThe following sensitivity analysis shows how the defined benefit obligation would have be en affected by changes \\nin significant actuarial assumptions, the discount rate and the rate of sickness premium increase.

The practice of the Pension Board has been to carry out an \\nactuarial valuation ever y two years using the Open Group Aggregate Method. The primary purpose of the actuarial \\nvaluation is to determine whether the current and estimated future assets of the Pension Fund will be sufficient to \\nmeet its liabilities.  \\n \\nWIPO’s financial obligation t o the Fund  consists of its mandated contribution, at the rate established by the United \\nNations General Assembly (currently at 7.9 per cent for participants and 15.8 per cent for member organizations) \\ntogether with any share of any actuarial deficiency pay ments under Article 26 of  the Regulations of the Fund. Such \\ndeficiency payments are only payable if and when the United Nations General Assembly has invoked the provision \\nof Article 26, following determination that there is a requirement for deficiency pay ments based on an assessment \\nof the actua rial sufficiency of the Fund as of the valuation date. Each member organization shall contribute to this \\ndeficiency an amount proportionate to the total contributions which each paid during the three years preceding  the \\nvaluation date.  \\n \\nThe latest actuarial valuation for the Fund was completed as at December 31, 2019, and a roll forward of the \\nparticipation data as at December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 will be used by the Fund for its 2020 financial \\nstatements.  \\n \\nThe actuarial valuation as at December 31, 2019, resulted in a funded ratio of actuarial assets to actuarial liabilities, \\nassuming no future pension adjustments, of 144.2 per cent ( 139.2 per cent in the 2017 valuation) . The funded ratio \\nwas 107.1 per cent  (102.7 per cent  in the 2017 valuation)  when the current system of pension adjustments was \\ntaken into account . \\n \\nAfter assessing the actuarial sufficiency of the Fund, the Consulting Actuary concluded that there was no \\nrequirement, as at December 31, 2019 , for deficiency payments under Article 26 of the Regulations of the Fund as \\nthe actuarial value of assets exceeded the actuarial value of all ac crued liabilities under the plan . In addition, the \\nmarket value of assets also exceeded the actuarial value of all  accrued liabilities as of the valuation date. At the \\ntime of this report, the General Assembly has not invoked the provision of Article 26 . \\n \\nShould Article 26  be invoked due to an actuarial deficiency, either during the ongoing operation or due to the \\ntermination of the  Fund , deficiency payments required from each member organization would be based upon the \\nproportion of that member organization’s contributions to the total contributions paid to the Fund during the three \\nyears preceding the valuation date.  Total contributions paid to the Fund  during  the preceding three years (2017, \\n2018 and 2019 ) amounted to 7,546.9  million  US dollars , of which 1.77 per cent was  contributed by WIPO (including \\nparticipants and Organization contributions) . \\n \\nDuring 2020 , WIPO contributions  (including Organization contributions only) paid to the Fund amounted to 29.0 \\nmillio n Swiss francs (29.2  million Swiss francs  in 2019 ). Expected contributions due in 2021  are approximately 28.1 \\nmillion  Swiss francs.  \\n \\nMembership of the Fund may be terminated by decision of the United Nations General Assembly, upon the \\naffirmative recomm endation of the Pension Board. A proportionate share of the total assets of the Fund at the date \\nof termination shall be paid to the former member organization  for the exclusive benefit of its staff who were \\nparticipants in the Fund at that date, pursuant to an arrangement mutually agreed between the orga nization and \\nthe Fund. The amount is determined b y the  Pension Board based on an actuarial valuation of the a ssets and \\nliabilities of the Fund on the date of termination; no part of the assets which are in excess of the liabilities is  included \\nin the amount.  \\n \\nThe United Nations Board of Auditors carries out an annual audit of the Fund  and reports to the Pension B oard and \\nto the United Nations General Assembly  on the audit every year. The Fund  publishes quarterly reports on its \\ninvestments and these can be viewed by visiting the Fund  at www.unjspf.org . \\n \\n  '),\n",

The following \\nmethods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Cash and short -term deposits, receivables from exchange transactions, accounts payable and other current \\nliabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short -term maturities of these instruments;  \\n\\uf0b7 Quoted investments (in investment funds which are publicly traded) are based on price quotations at the \\nreporting date;  \\n\\uf0b7 Derivative financial instruments are b ased on quoted prices, adjusted for the UNORE at reporting date;  \\n\\uf0b7 Loans and  receivables are evaluated by the Organization based on parameters such as interest rates and risk \\ncharacteristics.  \\n \\nFor WIPO’s financial assets and liabilities at the reporting date , the carrying amount is equivalent to the fair value.  \\n \\nFair V alue Hierarchy  \\n \\nFor those instruments categorized as fair value through surplus or deficit, fair values are classified according to the \\nfollowing hierarchy:  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active  markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1);  \\n\\uf0b7 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either \\ndirectly or indirectly (Level 2);  \\n\\uf0b7 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based o n observable market data (Level 3).  \\n \\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Fair Value Hierarchy\\nCash and cash equivalents Level 1\\nDerivative assets and liabilities Level 2\\nInvestments arising from core and strategic cash Level 1\\n \\nCredit Risk  \\n \\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Organization if counterparties to financial instruments fail to meet their \\ncontractual obligations, and it arises principally from the Organiz ation’s loans , receivables, cash and cash \\nequivalents , and investments . The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. \\nFor the purposes of financial reporting, WIPO calculates expected credit losses allowances associated with its \\nfinanc ial assets.  \\n \\nThe Organization’s receivables from non -exchange transactions are almost exclusively from its Member States \\nrepresenting sovereign governments, and therefore risks related to credit are considered minor. An allowance has \\nbeen established again st the asset value of accounts receivable to reflect receivables for which payment is not \\nanticipated in the short -term.  The allowance covers amounts due from Member States that have lost the right to \\nvote under Article 11, paragraph 5 of the WIPO Conventi on and contributions from least developed countries which \\nhave been frozen by action of the Assemblies  in 1989 and 1991.  \\n \\nIn accordance with the Organization’s Policy on Investments, deposits may only be held  with institutions with a \\nminimum short -term credit rating of A -2/P-2 or a minimum long -term credit rating of A/A2. Money market \\ninvestments, bonds, notes or other obligations and other fixed income products purchased directly by WIPO may \\nonly be held with  institutions with a minimum short -term credit rating of A -3/P-3 or a minimum long -term credit rating \\nof BBB -/Baa3. Where these are acquired as shares in pooled market traded funds, at least 65 per cent of the  \\nportfolio  holdings must be in Investment Grade  (AAA/Aaa to BBB -/Baa3), while the balance of up to 35 per cent \\nmay be held in high yield bonds (BB+/Ba1 to C/Ca). The credit ratings attached to cash and cash equivalents and \\ninvestments as at December 31, 2020 , is as follows : \\n '),\n",

Non -current investments held by WIPO are in investment funds which are \\nnot rated by credit rating agencies, but in which the underlying investments are made in accordan ce with WIPO’s Policy on Investments.  \\n \\nLiquidity Risk  \\n \\nLiquidity risk is the risk of the Organization not being able to meet its obligations as they fall due . \\n \\nThe Organization does not have significant exposure to liquidity risk as it has substantial unrestricted cash \\nresources which are replenis hed from the results of its operations. The Organization’s Policy on Investments \\nrequires that operating and core cash are invested in such a way to ensure the liquidity necessary to meet the \\nOrganization’s cash flow requirements. Operating cash balances a re invested over the short term (periods not \\nexceeding twelve months to maturity) in low -risk asset classes which are easily liquidated at  little or no cost. Core \\ncash  balances are  invested with the objective of generating a positive return over rolling fi ve year periods . Core \\ncash balances are invested ideally in such a way that occasional access to a portion of the cash is possible.  \\nStrategic cash  balances are  invested over the long term, and currently have  no short or medium term liquidity \\nrequirements.  \\n \\nCurrency Risk  \\n \\nThe Organization receives revenue from fees in currencies and incurs expenses in currencies other than its \\nfunctional currency, the Swiss franc, and is exposed  to foreign currency exchange risk arising from fluctuations of \\ncurrency exchange rates. For PCT international filing fees, WIPO establishes equivalent amounts in currencies \\nother than the Swiss franc, which can be reset during the year if the exchange rat e between the other currency and \\nSwiss franc is 5.0 per cent or more for more than four consecutive Fridays. The Organization is also exposed to \\nexchange risk arising from the currency differences between amounts payable to International Searching Authorit ies \\n(ISAs)  pursuant to the Regulations under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and amounts received by national patent \\noffices for international search fees from applicants for international patents.  The Organization  also operates  the \\nWIPO Fee Transfer Service , a netting structure  that reduce s the exposure of PCT fee income to movements in \\ncurrency exchange rates  with regard to search fees.  \\n \\nWhere investments are held in currencies other than the Swiss franc , the Organization may use derivative financial \\ninstru ments to minimize the risk arising from the fluctuation of the currency of the investment against the Swiss \\nfranc . Investment in derivatives for speculative purposes is not permitted.  As at December 31, 2020, the \\nOrganization held US dollar investments totalling 105.9  million  Swiss francs. The sensitivity of these investments \\nto exchange rate fluctuations is monitored, and derivative financial instruments are used to minimize this risk.  \\n \\nThe Organization’s contributions to the UNJSPF and its payments to ICC are made in US dollars. The Organization \\nhas a further exposure to exchange risk  in connection with the cost of pensions for staff  previously enrolled in the \\nClosed Pension Fund who are now members of the UNJSPF. In addition, the Organization has external offices in \\nAlgeria, Brazil, China, Japan, Nigeria, Russia and  Singapore , and a coordination office in the USA,  with limited \\nassets in local currency . \\n \\nMarket  Risk  \\n \\nMarket risk is the ri sk of changes in market prices, including in terest rates, affecting the Organization’s income or \\nthe value of its financial instrument holdings. Investmen t revenue in the Organization’s  budget for  the 2020/21  \\nProgram and Budget  is limited to interest on op erating cash balances . The Organization does not currently use \\nfinancial instruments to hedge interest rate risk.  WIPO’s medium -term investment portfolio (core cash) and long -\\nterm investment portfolio (strategic cash) are subject to the risk of movements in market prices of the underlying \\ninvestment funds. Based on historical experience for the investment strategies applied to these portfolios, the \\nexpected volatility for cor e cash and strategic cash is 3.40 per cent and 5.3 0 per cent respectively.  \\n \\n \\n  '),\n",

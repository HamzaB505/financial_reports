The financial statements have been prepared \\nin accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), as developed and approved by the \\nInternational Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB).  \\n \\nThe report of the External Auditor on th e audit of the 2020  financial statements, together with his opinion on the \\nfinancial statements, are also submitted to the WIPO Assemblies as prescribed under Regulation 8.11 and Annex \\nII of the FRR.  \\n \\nThe annual financial report, including financial statem ent discussion and analysis, is presented in this document \\nalongside the financial statements  and the  annual  statement on internal control . \\n \\n \\nFINANCIAL STATEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  \\n \\nThe following financial statement discussion and analysis includes an  overview of the Organization’s operations \\nand environment, financial objectives and strategies, risk management strategy, financial performance and financial \\nposition duri ng the year ended December 31, 2020 . This year, due to the unprecedented global impa ct of the \\nCOVID -19 pandemic, a separate overview of its effects  on the Organization ’s operations and financial results  has \\nalso been included. The discussion and analysis  has been prepared in accordance with IPSASB Recommended \\nPractice Guideline 2, and is intended to provide an explanation of the significant items, transactions, and events \\npresented in the financial statements and the factors that influenced them. This discussion and analysis is not part \\nof WIPO’ s financial statements; however  it should be read together w ith WIPO’s financial statements . \\n \\nOperations and Environment  \\n \\nWIPO is the global forum for intellectual property services, policy, information and cooperation. It is a specialized \\nagency  of the United Nations, with 193  Member States. The Organization’ s mission is to lead the development of a \\nbalanced and effective global  intellectual property ecosystem to promote  innovation and creativity fo r a better and \\nmore sustainable future . The Organization’s mandate, governing bo dies and procedures are set out in the WIPO \\nConvention  of 1967, which established WIPO . \\n \\nWIPO’s Member States determine the direction, budget and activities of the Organization through the decision -\\nmaking bodies. The main policy and decision -making bodies of WIPO are the General Assembly , the Conference  \\nand the Coordination Committee. The  General Assembly consists of States party to the WIPO Convention which \\nare members of any of the Unions administered by WIPO.  The General Assembly constituted  the Program and \\nBudget Committee to consider matters relating to program, budget, premises and finance. The Conference is \\ncomposed of the States party to the WIPO Convention whether or not they are members of any of the Unions, and \\nis, inter alia , the competent body f or adopting amendments to the Convention.  The Coordination Committee consists \\nof elected members of the Executive Committees of the Paris or the Berne Unions , or both , one -fourth of the States \\nparty to the WIPO Convention which are not members of any of th e Unions, and Switzerland, as the State on whose \\nterritory the Organization has its headquarters . \\n \\nThe General Assembly appoints the WIPO Director General upon nomination by the Coordination Committee.  The \\ncurrent Director General, Mr Daren Tang, was appointed on May 8, 2020, and began his six -year term on O ctober  1, \\n2020.  Mr Tang succeeds Mr Francis Gurry, who served as WIPO Director General from October 1, 2008. The \\nDirector General is the chief executive of the Organization. The Director General is assisted by the Se ctor Leads  \\n(consisting of the Deputy Directors General and t he Assistant Directors General) in providing  the strategic direction \\nof WIPO’s programs and in managing their  respective Sectors  to ensure the delivery of results in line with th e \\nOrganization’s strategic goals and the  Program and Budget.  \\n \\nWIPO generates mos t of its revenue from fees that  are paid by users of its intellectual property services for patents, \\ntrademarks and industrial designs. These services are provided through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), \\nMadrid and  Hague systems. In 2020 , fees from  these activities represented 94.3 per cent of the Organization’s total \\nrevenue, with PCT s ystem fees alone representing 76.6 per cent . The driver  for revenue from these fee -based  \\nservices is the international demand for intellectual property titles.  Other exte rnal factors that  may influence the \\nOrganization’s revenue from its fee -based  services include research and development investment levels, \\ntechnological confidence levels, an d exchange rate fluctuations.  \\n  '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\wipo_pub_rn2021_18e.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='WIPO ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2020  \\n \\n5 \\n Financial Objectives and Strategies  \\n \\nThe financial activities of WIPO are governed by its Financial Regulations, which are approved by the General \\nAssembly. Financial Rules are established by the Director General in accorda nce with the provisions of the Financial \\nRegulations. WIPO’s  Member States are  informed of any modification of the Financial Rules. The Financial Rules \\ngovern all the financial management activities of the Organization. Authority and responsibility for the  \\nimplementation of the Financial Regulations and Rules is delegated by the Director General to the Controller.  \\n \\nEvery two years, the Director General presents a Program and Budget to Member States for  approval. It details \\nexpected results , performance meas ures and budgetary planning for all proposed activities. The  Program and \\nBudget for the 2020/21  biennium was approved by the Assemblie s of the Member States of WIPO in October 2019 . \\nThe Program and Budget provides the planning for the biennium within the o verall strategic context of the Medium -\\nTerm Strategic Plan.  \\n \\nThe Organization uses a Results -Based Management system to ensure that resources are budgeted and utilized \\nin line with organizational results and priorities. Organizational performance is measur ed and analyzed on a regular \\nbasis through performance indicators, targets and baselines. Under this system, both the Program and Budget and \\nthe Medium -Term Strategic Plan form part of WIPO’s planning framework, along with annual work plans and \\nindividual staff objectives.  \\n \\nThe Organization manages the levels of its reserves in accordance with its Policy on Reser ves. WIPO’s reserves \\nare accounted for  as the net assets of the Organization, and serve to minimize the impact of income shortfalls and \\nmaximize the probability that the Organization can meet its obligations in the short term and maintain financial \\nstability. One core element of the policy is the mechanism for establishing the required level of reserves as a \\npercentage of the estimated biennial expenditure of the Unions administered by the Organization . The policy also \\nestablishes the principles and approval mechanism for the use of reserves fo r one -time projects for capital \\nimprovements and exceptional circumstances.  \\n \\nThe Organization manages its investments in accordance wit h its Policy on Investments. The policy states that the \\nprimary objectives of the Organization’s investment management, i n order of importance, shall be : (i) preservation \\nof capital; (ii) liquidity and (iii) within the constraints of (i) and (ii), the rate of return. The Organization aims to ach ieve \\na market rate of return whenever appropriate and possible for both operating  and core cash.  Strategic cash is to be \\ninvested over the long -term in order to achieve capital growth and thus an overall positive return over time.  \\n \\nRisk Management  \\n \\nWIPO’s Risk Management Policy sets out the Organization’s approach to managing risks and  internal controls in a \\nconsistent and business -oriented manner, in order to support the achievement of its strategic goals and expected \\nresults. It is complemented by WIPO’s Risk and Internal Control Management Manual, which covers the day -to-day \\noperatio nal details of risk and internal control management. The policy and the manual, together with the \\norganizational arrangements, the establishment of roles and responsibilities, processes and activities for the \\nmanagement of risks and internal controls repre sent WIPO’s Risk Management Framework . \\n \\nUnder the guiding principles of WIPO’s Risk Management Policy, risk management is considered an o rganization -\\nwide responsibility . Organizational level risks are identified and reviewed by WIPO’s Risk Management Group , \\nwhich is chaired by the Director General. Risk management is performed as an integral part of the Organization’s \\nResults -Based Management cycle. WIPO’s Risk Management Framework is guided  by the risk appetite noted by \\nits Member States in WIPO’s Risk App etite Statement . \\n \\nCOVID -19 Pandemic  \\n \\nThe World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the COVID -19 coronavirus a public health emergency of \\ninternational concern (PHEIC)  on January 30, 2020 . It subsequently declared the outbreak a pandemic on  March  11, \\n2020 . The pandemic became a global challenge and impacted the global economy in an unprecedented manner. \\nIn its 2019 f inancial statements, WIPO disclosed the outbreak as a non -adjusting event after the reporting date, in \\naccordance with IPSAS 14. This disclosure stated that , given the global effects of the pandemic, there would  be \\nsignificant impacts on the Organization’s operations in 2020, the extent of which could not reliably  be estimated at \\nthat time.  While the eventual impact  on the  way WIPO  condu cted its business  in 2020  was profound, the direct, \\nvisible and measurable impact on the financial performance for 2020 and the financial position at the end of the \\nyear was  more limited. Although  there can be no objective  or exact method of  determin ing the complete  impact of \\nthe COVID -19 pandemic on these financial statements, certain broad trends can be identified and are reflected in \\nthe following summary of the effects of the  pandemic on WIPO’s operation s and financial results.  \\n \\nOn March 1 7, 2020, WIPO  premises  at its headquarters in Geneva  were closed  in the face of the evolving health \\ncrisis and lockdown decisions mad e by the Host Government. Physical access to WIPO  was limited to  a smal l \\ncritical presence needed to perform essential services  on premi ses; all other staff continued to work remotely . The '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\wipo_pub_rn2021_18e.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='WIPO ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2020  \\n \\n6 \\n Organization already had in place a Business Continuity Plan that addressed the threat of significant disruption to \\ncritical functions, and was  quickly  able to adjust  to these unprecedent ed circumstances . During the initial phase of \\nthe crisis, staff were provided laptops and other equipment to permit them to connect to WIPO systems safely from \\nremote locations. WIPO servi ces, including fee -based  and support services , rapidly attained  near-optimal capacit y. \\nWith the gradual decline of infection rates in the Geneva region, and the scaling back of lockdown measures by the \\nHost Government, WIPO initiated a carefully planned and phased return -to-premises program in June 2020. \\nHowever , in October 2020 the epide miolog ical situation  in Geneva  rapidly deteriorated as the second wave of the \\nCOVID -19 pandemic gripped most of the world.  This culminated in the Host Government issuing a new series of \\nrecommendations , including for employers to implement remote working as much as possible. As of November 2, \\n2020, all WIPO personnel, except those required to be on -site, resumed remote working.  \\n \\nThe Organization monitored its directly related COVID -19 expenditure during 2020 , which totaled approximately 3.6 \\nmillio n Swiss francs. This concerned  principally  expenditure on IT equipment and IT services  to meet remote \\nworking and virtual or hybrid meeting requirements. Other expenditure considered directly related to the impacts of \\nCOVID -19 on the Organization’s operati ons included  cleaning and disinfection products, furniture and equipment \\nfor new layout requirements, purchase of medical supplies , additional medical staff,  and lunch allowances.  Travel \\nbans and restrictions  during 2020  had a significant  impact  on WIPO’s activities involving traditional, in -person \\nimplementation modalities, especially in the  areas of capacity building and support services . This required the \\nOrganization to  adapt  its delivery methods in order to respond to the constraints cause d by the pandemic. In financial \\nterms, the cost of missions for staff and consultants fell from 5.7 million Swiss francs in 2019, to 0.5 million Swiss \\nfrancs in 2020. Official meetings and conferences moved to hybrid and virtual modes  during the year. The \\nOrganization’s third party travel costs, including participants and lecturers, fell from 10.5 m illion Swiss francs in 2019 \\nto 0.5 million Swiss francs in 2020.   \\n \\nWIPO’s revenue from fees charged for applications under  the PCT, Madrid and Hague system s is recognized at \\nthe date of publication  of the application, in accordance with the requirements of IPSAS. As publication takes place \\nsome time after the filing of an application, reven ue levels from these systems do  not necessarily  provide  an \\nimmediate indicat ion of the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic for the Organization. Looking more specifically at \\nfilings of applications in 2020, overall  demand for WIPO’s fee -based  services under its intellectual property  systems \\nremained  strong  considering the unprecedente d circumstances . Revenue from the PCT system , based on \\npublications of PCT applications  in the year,  was 6.1  per cent higher than in 2019 , totaling 3 58.6 million  Swiss \\nfrancs . PCT application filings also grew in 2020, reaching an estimated 275,900 applications, a record figure and \\na 4.0 per cent increase on the 2019 number of 265,381.  Revenue from the Madrid system, again  recognized at the \\ndate of publication of the application, fell by 0.8 per cent compared to 2019, totaling 76.2 million Swiss fran cs. Use \\nof the M adrid system also slightly  decrease d in 2020 . International trademark applications totaled  an estimated \\n63,800, down by 0.6 per cent on the 2019 number of 64,168, representing  the first decline since the global financial \\ncrisis of 2008 -2009 . This was expected, given that trademarks tend to represent the introduction of new goods and \\nservices, both of which slowed as a result of the global pandemic.  The economic fallout from the pandemic also hit \\ndemand for the protection of industrial design s via the Hague system. Applications fell by 1.7 per cent, and designs \\nin those applications dropped by 15.0 per cent. Revenue from the Hague system  in 2020 actually increased from \\n5.3 million Swiss francs in 2019 to 6.7 million Swiss francs  as registratio n publication volumes increased over the \\nyear. The reduced demand for the Hague system seen in 2020 may be expected to impact revenue in 2021.   \\n \\nConcerning the Organization’s assets, as at each year end and in  accordance  with the requirements of IPSAS , \\nWIPO performed its annual impairment reviews to ensure that assets were recorded at an appropriate value in the \\nfinancial statements. This exercise did not indicate any im pairment attributable to the impacts of the COVID -19 \\npandemic.  The review of financial i nstruments in cluding accounts receivable, revealed  no impact on payment \\npatterns that would require recognition of credit loss.  Although the Organization’s buildings  were  utilized to a much \\nlower extent in 2020 than in 2019, no impairment was considered ne cessary for these long -term assets. For the \\nOrganization’s liabilities, the most noticeable consequence of the pandemic was an increase of 5.8 million Swiss \\nfrancs in the accumulated annual leave liability,  largely due to the impact of staff not taking the ir planned leave \\nentitlements in 2020 as a result of travel limitations.  Due to these limitations, as an exceptional measure for  2020 , \\nthe Organization increased the maximum annual accrual and carry -forward balance for annual leave.  \\n \\nAt the end of 2020, the Organization achieved  investment  gains of 33. 4 million Swiss francs. Global f inancial \\nmarkets reacted strongly to the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic in February and March  2020 .

The A SHI \\nliability increased by 1 39.1 million Swiss francs compared to the 201 9 balance . The calculation of the  ASHI liability \\nis performed by an independent actuary . In accordance with IPSAS requirements, the ASHI liability recognized in \\nthe financial statements represents the present value of all expected future benefits to existing retirees and their \\ndependents, and all accrued post -employment benefits of active staff. On average, medical costs increase with age, \\nso the most significant expected medical costs remain to be paid in the future. To manage the cost and risk of its \\ncollective medical insurance plan, WIPO has secured an insurance contract that allows a level pe r person premium \\nto be paid for existing retirees and active staff, thus reducing the cash paid on behalf of older retirees relative to \\ntheir incurred medical  cost.    \\n \\nThe ASHI liability calculation  incorporates a number of actuarial assumptions. These in clude the discount  rate, \\nmedical cost trend rates,  age-grading for medical claims,  retirement  rates a nd mortality rates. Changes to these \\nassumptions year on year lead to actuarial gains and losses which are recognized as part of the liability in the \\nState ment of Financial Position.  A breakdown of the movement in the liability due to actuarial gains and losses is \\nprovided in Note 10 of these financial statements.  The increase in the liability in 2020 was mainly due to a \\nmodification of the expected future a ge-related medical costs. The ASHI liability is the ultimate cost of providing \\nfuture post -employment medical costs, derived from the medical insurance premiums by applying an age -specific \\ngrading factor based on an  analysis of recent claims data which  has led to changes and increases at certain age \\ngroups . This is different from considering only the medical insurance premiums , which are mitigated by  lower \\nexpected costs for the younger staff and new joiners . \\n \\nOther changes to actuarial assumptions incl uded a  further lowering of  the discount rate from 0.50  per cent to 0.30 \\nper cent , which  also led to an increase in the liability . This was partly offset by a decrease in the medical cost trend \\nrate from  3.00 per cent to 2.90 per cent.  The following graph s hows how the ASHI liability has  developed since \\n2016 , and includes actuarial forecasts for 20 21-2024 (applying the same assumptions as for the 2020  calculation). \\nThe graph also shows how discount rates and medical cost tre nd rates have changed since 2016 :  \\n \\n  '),\n",

The projected increase in \\nthe liability for 2021 -2024 reflects the demographic make -up of participants in WIPO’s collective medical insurance \\nplan.

The Organization gene rally holds \\nits cash deposits in instant a ccess bank accounts. During 2020  the Organization continued to hold balances in term \\ndeposit accounts (for periods up to 12 months). This has allowed the Organization to reduce the level of  charges \\non certain insta nt access bank accounts following the introduction of negative interest rates during 201 5. \\n \\nAs at December 3 1, 2020 , WIPO’s medium -term investment portfolio (core cash invest ments) had a fair value of \\n471.7  million Swiss francs, and the long -term investmen t portfolio (strategic cash investments) had a fair valu e of \\n200.6 million Swiss francs . WIPO’s non -current investments are held at fair value in the Statement of  Financial \\nPosition. Fair value increases in these  investment portfolio assets during 2020, as  noted above,  reflect short term \\nmarket volatility.

The aim of this system of internal control is to manage risk to a tolerable \\nlevel rather than to eliminate it entirely. As such, it sets out to provide reasonable assurance over the:  \\n \\nReliability of financial reporting – transactions authorized and properly recorded and material errors or irregularities \\nare either prevented or detected in a timely manner;  \\nEffectiveness and efficiency of processes, the safeguarding of  assets and the exercise of econ omy;  and \\nCompliance with WIPO’s regulatory framework and any other applicable rules and  regulations.  \\n \\nThis Statement is presented in line with the seven components of WIPO’s Accountability Framework \\n(WO/PBC/29/4), which itself is aligned to the COSO framew ork and Three Lines Model.  \\n \\nMy current statement on WIPO’s internal control processes, as described above, applies for the year ended \\nDecember 31, 2020, and up to the date of the approval of the Organization’s 2020 financial statements.  \\n \\n1. Results based plan ning  \\n \\nResource needs are driven  by the substantive work program planned for implementation during a biennium, in \\naccordance with the Medium Term Strategic Plan (MTSP).  Member States’ approval of the 2020/21 Program and \\nBudget sets the implementation parameters for the biennium, and con trol processes centered on the WIPO FRRs \\nensure that WIPO Programs are implemented in accordance with those approvals.  \\n \\nAnnual workplanning, implementation and monitoring are controlled via a suite of enterprise resource management \\ntools and appropriate wo rk processes throughout the biennium.  \\n \\n2. Performance and risk management  \\n \\nThe year represented a period of significant uncertainty and disruption globally.  In order to provide assurance \\npublicly, WIPO published monthly crisis management dashboards on its website. Despite the disruptions, income \\nwas higher than forecasted, and this demonstrates to some extent, the resilien ce of the global IP ecosystem.  At \\nthe organizational level, I chaired the Crisis Management Team and the Risk Management Group. These structures \\nwork together to manage the Organization’s overall risk portfolio as outlined in the WIPO Risk Appetite Statem ent, \\nin the context of the global health and economic crisis.  Critical risks and appropriate responses were reviewed \\nregularly. These include the following key risks that we faced in 2020 and beyond:  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Program Delivery Risk  \\n \\nThe Covid -19 pandemic and the restrictions related to on -site presence, travel and meetings placed severe pressure \\non some Programs to deliver planned activities.   \\n '),\n",

However, those of WIPO’s Programs that \\nare largely dependent on traditional, in -person implementation modalities for the holding of meetings and capacity \\nbuilding events continued to be signif icantly impacted by the pandemic. These Programs have adapted their content \\nand delivery methods in order to respond to the temporary constraints caused by the pandemic.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Financial Risk  \\n \\nParticularly in light of the Covid -19 situation, the risk that revenu e would be lower than initially forecast, or that the \\nvalue of some investments made under the investment strategies for operating, core and strategic cash pools could \\ndecrease, was exacerbated.   \\n \\nControl and mitigation:  Filing numbers continued to remai n resilient throughout 2020 with the Organizational income \\ncorrespondingly strong.  There was a significant planned ‘buffer’ between forecast revenue and planned \\nexpenditure.  Investments continued to be under close review and oversight by the Advisory Com mittee on \\nInvestments with the assistance of independent investment advisors throughout the year and through monthly \\nreporting to the IAOC.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Cyber Risk  \\n \\nWIPO is exposed to the risk of cyber -attacks, potentially more so during remote working modalities, an d the risk of \\nmalicious or accidental breach of data leading to unauthorized disclosure or misuse of WIPO’s confidential \\ninformation, or disruption of business operations remained.  \\n \\nControl and mitigation:  WIPO continues to implement a number of phased fit -for-purpose information assurance \\nstrategies across governance, people, processes and technologies, to strengthen its information security posture \\nand its resilience against evolvi ng cyber security threats.   \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Strategic Risk  \\n \\nRisk that WIPO’s Global IP services fail to keep pace and remain the best value option for IP protection, or the \\nperceived value of IP protection declines, in the context of a rapidly changed global economic, political and \\ntechnological landscape, including from the Covid -19 pandemic.  \\n \\nControl and mitigation: WIPO will engage and communicate more effectively around the world on IP and connect it \\nmore clearly to the improvement of lives and livelihoods, and more  broadly, to its power as a tool to catalyze \\neconomic and societal benefits. To ensure that our services continue to bring value to users, we will continue to \\nscan, understand and use emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, block chain, digi tal time stamping \\nand digital media in improving our services.  \\n \\n3. Monitoring, Oversight, Complaints and Response Mechanisms  \\n \\nAs Director General of WIPO, I am ultimately accountable for the effectiveness of the system of internal controls.  \\nMy assertion is s upported and informed by:  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 A statement on internal control from the former Director General, referring to the period January 1 to Septem ber \\n30, 2020 which has been reviewed by me and the Risk Management Group and is supported by Management \\nRepresentation Letters (MRL);  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The Deputy Directors General and Assistant Directors General in office in 2020, who have signed MRLs from \\nwhich I derive assurance.  These letters recognize their responsibility for having and maintaining, in the Sectors \\nfor which they were  responsible, well -functioning systems and a mechanism for internal control aimed at \\npreventing and/or detecting instances of fraud and major  errors;  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The Risk Management Group (RMG) whose purpose is to promote a culture of responsible risk management \\nin WIPO and reviews and monitors WIPO’s financial situation, the key risks to the achievement of Expected \\nResults and this present Statement together with the evidence that supports it;  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The Chief Ethics Officer, who is accountable for ensuring the design, de velopment and implementation of an \\neffective Ethics program to enhance integrity, compliance with ethics rules, and the ethical conduct of the \\nOrganization’s business. WIPO’s Code of Ethics, and policies on Financial Disclosure and Declaration of \\nInterests , Protect Against Retaliation for Reporting Misconduct and for Cooperating with Duly Authorized Audits \\nor Investigations further contribute to setting the right tone in this area;  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The Internal Oversight Division (IOD), on whose assurance and advisory serv ices I rely, through reports of \\ninternal audit and evaluation as well as management implication reports resulting from investigations.  These \\nreports include recommendations, independent and objective observations on the efficiency and effectiveness '),\n",

Its mandate includes the promotion of internal controls, \\nreviewing the effectiveness and operational independence of the internal oversight function, and reviewing and \\nadvising on the ethics function;  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The Joint Inspection Unit of the United Nations  System, which is mandated to conduct evaluations, inspections \\nand investigations system -wide;  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The External Auditor, whose audit aims to provide independent assurance to Member States, to add value to \\nWIPO's financial management and governance, and to support its objectives through the external audit \\nprocess;  and \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The Governing Bodies’  observations . \\n \\nI further ensure that Feedback Mechanisms are in place for Member States, Customer Complaint Resolution \\nServices are in place for clients and that Informal and Formal Conflict Resolution Mechanisms are in place for staff.  \\n \\n4. Control Activities  \\n \\nOver 380 P rocess Level Controls are management controls that ensure the effective and efficient functioning of \\nend-to-end business processes and the compliance with the Organization’s regulatory framework.  These controls \\nare assessed annually for strength, in parti cular their maturity, automation and level of documented evidence.  The \\nresults are reported to the RMG and the IAOC in the WIPO Assurance Summary.   \\n \\nDuring 2020 , the Organization largely moved to a virtual working environment as a result of the Covid pan demic.  \\nControl activities continued to be undertaken in the virtual environment as previously, ensuring the robust control \\nenvironment was maintained.  However, over the course of the year, some controls were digitalized or otherwise \\nmodified, for example , electronic signatures in place of hand written authorization. We continued to make \\nimprovements the system of assurance including the development of a strategy that defines the increased use of \\ndata analytics for internal controls  as well as an increased  identification of internal controls in the areas of \\nInformation Security, Information Technology, Enterprise Solutions, and Staff Development.  Looking forward, we \\nanticipate initiating implementation of the above strategy and a focus on control assessmen ts for External Offices.  \\n \\n5. Information and Communication  \\n \\nThe RMG is kept  informed of risks and controls through access to our business intelligence system.  Quarterly risk \\nreports and annual risk management reports take stock of the evolving situation periodically.  External specialist \\nrisk intelligence provides independent ad vice to ensure a comprehensive view, and internally, an annual survey to \\nsenior staff tests their level of confidence in accountability systems at W IPO. \\n \\nA robust Information and Data Governance Framework is in place reflecting its importance to WIPO.   A Master Data \\nManagement Policy provides a directive control for managing critical data and provides a n authorit ative point of \\nreference for integration  into the enterprise architecture.  An information classification and handling policy provides \\na preventive  control raising understanding and application of levels of information confidentiality.  \\n \\nThe portfolio of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solutions provide a high level of control, including transactional \\nlevel system controls and data analytics.  The Enterprise Risk Management solution ensures controls are \\nsystematically owned, assessed and as appropriate linked to risks.   The annual WIPO Performance Report \\npresented to Member States includes a review of the evolution and impact of risks on the deliver y of Expected \\nResults for each Program.  \\n \\n6. Ethical Standards and Integrity  \\n \\nThe conduct and actions of WIPO staff must always adhere to the highest ethical standards, as set out in the WIPO \\nCode of Ethics.   Ethics training is provided to all staff through th e Ethics Office and fraud awareness training  has \\nbeen completed by over 96 per cent of staff.  \\n \\nWIPO has in place Organization -wide anti -fraud controls, in accordance with good practices and applicable \\ninternational standards, based on risk assessments.   Appropriate fraud prevention, detection, response and data \\ncollection procedures and processes exist in the Organization, reflecting WIPO’s comprehensive anti -fraud \\ngovernance framework.  \\n \"),\n",

WIPO’s procurement policy and procedures include a rob ust delegation \\nmodel for procurement authority as well as additional controls and reporting.  A Vendor Sanctions policy and a Code \\nof Conduct for Staff Involved in Procurement actions represent important control processes.   \\n \\nWIPO’s Core Values are express ed as “Shaping the Future”, “Acting Responsibly”, “Delivering Excellence” and \\n“Working as One”, and all contribute to fostering a culture of accountability and strong ethical values.  \\n \\nConclusion  \\n \\nBased on the contents of this statement and the evidence tha t underpins it, I conclude that, to the best of my \\nknowledge and information, there have been no material weaknesses that would affect the reliability of the \\nOrganization’s financial statements, nor are there significant matters arising which would need to  be raised in the \\npresent document for the period covered.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Daren Tang  \\n Director General  \\n \\n June 18, 2021  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n'),\n",

WIPO was recognized as a specialized agency of the United Nations  in 1974 . WIPO is \\nbased in Geneva, Switzerland , and enjoys privile ges and immunities as granted under the 1947 Convention on  the \\nPrivileges and Immunities of  the Specialized Agencies of the United Nations and the 1970 Headquarters Agreement \\nwith the Swiss Federal  Council, notably being exempt from paying most forms of di rect and indirect taxation.  WIPO \\nalso has external offices in Abuja, Algiers, Beijing, Moscow, Rio de Janeiro, Singapore and Tokyo, along with a \\ncoordination office in New York.  \\n \\nWIPO  promot es innovation and creativity for the economic, social and cultural  development of all countries, through \\na balanced and effective international intellectual property system. WIPO’s broad -ranging activities include the \\nfollowing  main areas of work: providing intellectual property services through the Organization’s Global  IP \\nsystems;   developing and maintaining th e technical infrastructure that  not only supports the international IP system, \\nbut also provides access to its outputs, enhances data flows, and enables global cooperation;   serving as a \\nmultilateral forum for dis cussions on the normative development of intellectual property policy;   and facilitating the \\nuse of IP for social, cultural and economic development, by mainstreaming development considerations and \\ndelivering development cooperation activities horizontally  across all of the Organization’s programs . \\n \\nWIPO is funded from fees derived from services provided by the Organization, assessed contributions paid by its \\nMember States , and voluntary contributions from Member States and other donors. The Organization op erates \\nwithin the framework of a biennial program and budget which provides the appropriations that constitute the \\nbudgetary expenditure authorizations approved by the Assemblies for the  financial period. The approval of the \\nappropriations provides the authority for the Director General to commit and authorize expenses and to make \\npayments for the purposes assigned within the limits of the appropriations . \\n \\n \\nNote 2: Significant Accounting Policies  \\n \\nBasis of Preparation  \\n \\nThese  financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and comply with International Public Sector \\nAccounting Standards (IPSAS). The financial statements are presented in Swiss francs, which is the reporting and \\nfunctional currency of WIPO, and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand. The accounting policies have \\nbeen applied consistently to all years presented . \\n \\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost , unless stated otherw ise. The Statement \\nof Cash F low is prepared using the indirect method. The financial statements are prepared on an accrual and going -\\nconcern basis.  \\n \\nIPSAS 42 Social Benefits , was published in January 2019 with an original implementation date of January 1, 2022.  \\nThis implementation date has now been deferred to January 1, 2023 due to the COVID -19 pandemic and the \\nchallenges it has created. It is not expected that this standard will impact the Organization’s financial statements . \\n \\nCash and Cash Equivalents  \\n \\nCash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, deposits held up to 90 days and \\nother short -term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash and subject to insignificant risk of \\nchanges in value . \\n \\nInvestments  \\n \\nInvestments are classified as current or non -current assets according to the time horizon of the investment \\nobjectives. If the time horizon is less than or equal to one year, they are classified as current assets, and if it is more \\nthan one ye ar, they are classified as non -current assets . \\n \\nForeign Currency Transactions  \\n \\nThe functional currency of WIPO is the Swiss franc. All transactions occurring in other currencies are translated into \\nSwiss francs using the United Nations Operational Rates of  Exchange (UNORE) which represent those prevailing \\nat the date of the transactions. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such \\ntransactions and from the translation at the reporting date of assets and liabilities de nominated in currencies other \\nthan WIPO’s functional currency are recognized in the Statement of Financial Performance .

Revenue \\nfrom fees received for applications n ot published at the reporting date is deferred until publication has been \\ncompleted. The portion of the PCT application fee covering the costs of translation of non -English language \\npatentability reports received after publication is also deferred until th e translation is completed. All other fees under \\nthe PCT, Madrid and Hague systems are recognized when the services covered by the fee have been provided. \\nRevenue from publications  is recognized upon full delivery of the goods.  Revenue from  Arbitration and  Mediation \\nservices is recognized upon delivery of the  services  related to the submission of a request covered by the fee \\nreceived . \\n \\nRevenue from non -exchange transactions such as voluntary contributions to Special Accounts supported by \\nenforceable agreeme nts is recognized as revenue at the time the agreement becomes binding unless the \\nagreement includes conditions related to specific performance or the return of unexpended balances. Such \\nagreements require initial recognition of a liability to defer revenu e recognition and then revenue is recognized as \\nthe liability is discharged through performance of the specific conditions included in the agreement.  \\n \\nAssessed contributions are recognized as revenue at the beginning of each year of the budget period to wh ich the \\nassessment relates.  \\n \\nExpense Recognition  \\n \\nExpenses are recognized as goods are received and as services are delivered.  \\n \\nReceivables  \\n \\nReceivables from exchange transactions include fees which are charged to users of WIPO’s intellectual property \\nservices through the PCT, Madrid and Hague systems. These are measured at the fair value of the consideration \\nreceivable for PCT, Madrid and Hague system fees once the international application has been filed . \\n \\nReceivables from non -exchange transactions includ e uncollected assessed contributions. These are measured at \\nthe fair value of the consideration receivable. An allowance for non -recoverable receivables is recorded equal to \\nthe assessed contributions frozen by action of the General Assembly in 1989 and 19 91, plus contributions \\nreceivable from Member States that have lost the right to vote in accordance with Article 11, paragraph 5 of the \\nWIPO Convention . \\n \\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment  \\n \\nEquipment is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Equipment is recognized a s an asset \\nif it has a cost of 10 ,000 Swiss francs or more per unit. Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing \\nthe proceeds with the carrying amount of the asset and are included in the Statement of Financial Performance. \\nHeritage assets including donated works of art are not valued in the financial statements . \\n \\nLand is carried at fair value as determined by an independent valuation in accordanc e with International Valuation \\nStandards. Changes in fair value are recognized directly in net assets through the Revaluation Reserve Surplus. \\nBuildings and constructions in use are valued at the cost of construction when new plus the cost of subsequent \\nimprovements, less accumulated depreciation. For the initial recognition of buildings in use as at January 1, 2010, \\nthe date of transition to IPSAS, the value when new was determined by reference to a deemed cost calculated by \\nan external consultant and repr esenting the value of each component at construction plus improvements existing \\nat the initial recognition, less accumulated depreciation based upon the remaining useful life of each component. \\nSubsequent costs of major renovations and improvements to buil dings and constructions that increase or extend \\nthe future economic benefits or service potential are valued at cost.  \\n \\nDepreciation is charged so as to write off the full cost of property, plant, and equipment over its estimated useful \\nlife using the strai ght-line method. Where property, plant, and equipment is only in use for part of the year (due to \\nacquisition, disposal or retirement during the year), depreciation is charged only for the months during which the \\nasset was in use.

If such an indication exists, the \\nrecoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment loss, if any. Any \\nimpairment loss is recognized in the Statement of Financial Performance . \\n \\nIntangible Assets  \\n \\nIntangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Amortization is provided on a \\nstraight -line basis on all intangible assets of finite life, at rates that will write off the cost or value of the assets o ver \\ntheir useful lives. The useful lives of major classes of intangible assets have been estimated as follows : \\n \\nClass Estimated useful life\\nSoftware externally acquired 5 years\\nSoftware internally developed 5 years\\nLicenses and rights Period of licence/right\\n \\nAcquired computer software licenses are capitalized based on costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific \\nsoftware. Software or sof tware licenses purchased externally are recognized as an asset if they have a cost of \\n20,000 Swiss francs or more per unit. Costs that are directly associated with the internal development of software \\nfor use by WIPO are capitalized as intangible assets on ly if the recognition criteria under IPSAS 31 are met. Direct \\ncosts include the software development employee costs.  \\n \\nThe rights to use property in the Canton of Geneva acquired by the Organization through purchase have been \\nrecognized at historic cost and  are amortized over the remaining period of the grant.  The rights to use property \\ngranted by the Canton of Geneva acquired without cost, that revert back to the Canton at the end of the grant, are \\nnot valued in the financial statements . \\n \\nFinancial Assets  \\n \\nFinancial assets  are recognized initially at fair value, normally being the transaction price. The subsequent \\nmeasurement of financial assets depends on their classification. WIPO classifies its financial assets as either \\nmeasured at amortized cost or mea sured at fair value through surplus or deficit. The classification depends on \\nWIPO’s management model for the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial \\nassets. WIPO assesses on a forward looking basis the expected cred it losses associated with its financial assets \\nclassified as measured at amortized cost.  \\n \\n \\n '),\n",

After initial recognition, financial liabilities are \\nsubsequently measure d at amortized cost.  \\n \\nDerivative Financial Instruments  \\n \\nWIPO uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency risks. \\nThese financial instruments are initially recognized  at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is \\nentered into and are subsequently re -measured at fair value . \\n \\nEmployee Benefits  \\n \\nLiabilities are established for After -Service Health Insurance (ASHI), repatriation grants and travel , and long-term \\naccumulated annual leave  as determined by an independent actuary on an annual basis utilizing the projected unit \\ncredit methodology of valuation. For the ASHI liability , actuarial gains and losses are recognized in net assets . In \\naddition, liabil ities are established for the value of short -term accumulated  annual  leave, home leave not taken, \\novertime earned but unpaid, separation benefits, performance rewards , and for education grants payable at the \\nreporting date that have not been included in cu rrent expenditure . \\n \\nWIPO is a member organization participating in the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund ( the Fund ), which was \\nestablished by the United Nations General Assembly to provide retirement, death, disability and related ben efits to \\nemploye es. The Fund is a funded, multi -employer defined benefit plan. As specified by Article 3(b) of the \\nRegulations of the Fund, membership in the Fund shall be open to the specialized agencies and to any other \\ninternational, intergovernmental organization whic h participates in the common system of salaries, allowances and \\nother conditions of service of the United Nations and the specialized agencies . \\n \\nThe Fund  exposes participating organizations to actuarial risks associated with the current and former employee s \\nof other organizations participating in the Fund, with the result that there is no consistent and reliable basis for \\nallocating the obligation, plan assets, and costs to individual organizations participating in the Fund . WIPO and the \\nFund , in line with the other participating organizations in the Fund, are not in a position to identify WIPO’s \\nproportionate share of the defined benefit obligation, the plan assets and the costs associated with the plan with \\nsufficient reliability for accounting purposes. H ence WIPO has treated this plan as if it were a defined contribution \\nplan in line with the requirements of IPSAS 39 Employee Benefits . WIPO’s contributions to the Fund  during the \\nfinancial period are  recognized as expenses in the Statement of Financial P erformance . \\n \\nLeases  \\n \\nFinance leases are recogniz ed as assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position at the lower of the fair \\nvalue of the leased item or the present value of the minimum lease payments at the commencement of the lease \\nterm. Th e finance charge is charged to surplus or deficit over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic \\nrate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. The amount recogniz ed as an asset is depreciated over its \\nuseful life.  \\n \\nOperating l ease  payments are recogniz ed as an expense on a straight -line basis over the lease term.  \\n \\nProvisions  \\n \\nProvisions are recognized when the Organization has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, \\nwhereby it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and where a reliable \\nestimate of the amount of the obligation can be made . \\n \\nNet Assets  \\n \\nThe Organization’s net assets represent the balance of its reserves, which include its Reserves (Accumulated \\nSurpluses, Special Projects Reserve and Revaluation Reserve Surplus) and Working Capital Funds. The \\nOrganization also recognizes actuarial gains and losses directly through net assets. The Organization manages the \\nlevel of its reserves in accordance with i ts Policy on Reserves . \\n \\nThe Accumulated Surpluses of the Organization represent the accumulated net result of operations in the reporting \\nyear and prior periods after the impact of IPSAS.  WIPO’s Policy on Reserves establishes the principles and approval \\nmechanism for the use of reserves for one -time projects for capital improvements and exceptional circumstances. \\nThe Special Projects Reserve contains the appropriations to these projects financed from reserves, less \\naccumulated expenditure . The Revaluation  Reserve Surplus includes the cumulative results of revaluations of the \\nland owned by the Organization on which the New Building has been constructed .

The Working Capital \\nFunds are financed by contributions and are held in trust by WIPO for the Member States of the respective  Unions.  \\n \\nSegment Reporting  \\n \\nSegment reporting is based upon the Unions that form WIPO. Revenue and expenses incurred by the Organization \\nare allocated among the Unions in accordance with an allocation methodology approved by the WIPO A ssembly \\n(Program and  Budget 2020/21 , Annex III ). The methodology allocates revenue and expenses to each program and \\nthen to each Union based on a combination of direct revenue and expense, staff head count and each Union’s \\n“capacity  to pay ”. Direct Union expenses are allocate d to Unions either fully or on the basis of estimates by Program \\nManagers. Direct administrative expenses are allocated to the Unions based on relative headcount shares. Indirect \\nUnion expenses and indirect administrative expenses are allocated to the Unio ns based on the “capacity -to-pay” \\nprinciple. If the Union has a reserve level above its reserve target, it is deemed to be able to support indirect \\nactivities. The “capacity to pay” is calculated as the difference between a Union’s projected biennial incom e and its \\ndirect Union and direct administrative expenses. The extent to which this support can be provided by each Union is \\ncalculated by considering the relative extent to which the Union’s income exceeds its direct expenditure.  The only \\ninter-segment ch arge represents the costs of program support incurred by the Unions in support of Special \\nAccounts. Program support costs are charged to the Special Accounts based on a percentage of total direct \\nexpenditure specified in the agreement with the donor making  the voluntary contribution. WIPO’s assets and \\nliabilities are not allocated to individual segments, since ownership rests with the Organization as a whole, however, \\neach Union’s share of the Organization’s net assets including Reserves and Working Capital  Funds is re cognized \\nby segment.  \\n \\nChanges in Presentation  \\n \\nIn the Statement of Financial Position the basis for allocating long -term employee benefit liabilities between current \\nand non -current liabilities has been modified. Previously the current allocati on was based on the expected expense \\nin the following twelve months, and this has been changed to reflect the amounts expected to be settled in the \\nfollowing twelve months . This  modification results in a  presentation of the current portion  of benefits incl uded in  the \\nbenefit obligation as it stands at the reporting date. As a result of this change, 24.2 million Swiss francs has been \\nreallocated from current to non -current employee benefits in the 2019 comparative numbers in the Statement of \\nFinancial Positi on. \\n \\nUse of Estimates  \\n \\nThe financial statements necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. \\nEstimates include, b ut are not limited to: ASHI, repatriation grants and travel , and long -term accumulated annual \\nleave  liabilities (the value of which are calculated by an independent actuary), other employee benefit liabilities, \\nprovisions for litigation, financial risk on accounts receivable, accrued charges and the degree of impairment of \\nfixed assets.

Staff in posts  may normally  accrue up to 15 days \\nof annual leave in a given year, and a total accu mulated balance of 60 days.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing, due to \\nthe COVID -19 pandemic exceptional measures were introduced to allow the accrual of up to 20 days annual leave \\nin 2020, and a total accumulated balance of 80 days to be carried forward to 202 1. On separation from service, \\nstaff in posts who have accumulated annual leave can receive a payment in lieu of an amount equivalent to their \\nsalary for the period of accumulated annual leave, up to a maximum of 60 days.  \\n \\nEmployee benefit liabilities for ASHI, repatriation grant and travel, and accumulated leave (posts) are calculated by \\nan independent actuary.

Consistent with the approach taken in 2019, in the \\n2020 actuar ial calculation age -grading factors have been applied to premiums to derive the expected future \\nunderlying medical claims costs for active staff, retirees and dependents. The 2020 age -grading factors were based \\non an analysis of claims data over a four -year period which led to changes in the factors compared to those applied \\nin the prior year. No specific modifications were made to any of the 2020 actuarial assumptions, including those \\nrelated to medical claims or mortality rates, as a result of  the COVID -19 pandemic. Currently there is insufficient \\navailable information to understand the long -term effects of COVID -19 on these future trends . Contributions paid \\nby the O rganization for ASHI totaled 3.9 million Swiss francs for 2020 (3.7  million  Swiss francs in  2019 ). Expected \\ncontributions to ASHI in 20 21 are 4.9 million  Swiss francs. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit \\nobligation as at December 31, 2020, was 23 years. The  following table details the present value of the defined \\nbenefit obligation and experience adjustments  on the ASHI liability for 2020 and the previous four years : \\n \\n2020 2019 2018 2017 2016\\nDefined benefit obligation 452,755 313,694 303,128 304,376 320,888\\nExperience (gain)/loss adjustments on plan liability 2,400 -37,983 -3,092 -17,122 3,377(in thousands of Swiss francs)\\n \\nThe following sensitivity analysis shows how the defined benefit obligation would have be en affected by changes \\nin significant actuarial assumptions, the discount rate and the rate of sickness premium increase.

The practice of the Pension Board has been to carry out an \\nactuarial valuation ever y two years using the Open Group Aggregate Method. The primary purpose of the actuarial \\nvaluation is to determine whether the current and estimated future assets of the Pension Fund will be sufficient to \\nmeet its liabilities.  \\n \\nWIPO’s financial obligation t o the Fund  consists of its mandated contribution, at the rate established by the United \\nNations General Assembly (currently at 7.9 per cent for participants and 15.8 per cent for member organizations) \\ntogether with any share of any actuarial deficiency pay ments under Article 26 of  the Regulations of the Fund. Such \\ndeficiency payments are only payable if and when the United Nations General Assembly has invoked the provision \\nof Article 26, following determination that there is a requirement for deficiency pay ments based on an assessment \\nof the actua rial sufficiency of the Fund as of the valuation date. Each member organization shall contribute to this \\ndeficiency an amount proportionate to the total contributions which each paid during the three years preceding  the \\nvaluation date.  \\n \\nThe latest actuarial valuation for the Fund was completed as at December 31, 2019, and a roll forward of the \\nparticipation data as at December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 will be used by the Fund for its 2020 financial \\nstatements.  \\n \\nThe actuarial valuation as at December 31, 2019, resulted in a funded ratio of actuarial assets to actuarial liabilities, \\nassuming no future pension adjustments, of 144.2 per cent ( 139.2 per cent in the 2017 valuation) . The funded ratio \\nwas 107.1 per cent  (102.7 per cent  in the 2017 valuation)  when the current system of pension adjustments was \\ntaken into account . \\n \\nAfter assessing the actuarial sufficiency of the Fund, the Consulting Actuary concluded that there was no \\nrequirement, as at December 31, 2019 , for deficiency payments under Article 26 of the Regulations of the Fund as \\nthe actuarial value of assets exceeded the actuarial value of all ac crued liabilities under the plan . In addition, the \\nmarket value of assets also exceeded the actuarial value of all  accrued liabilities as of the valuation date. At the \\ntime of this report, the General Assembly has not invoked the provision of Article 26 . \\n \\nShould Article 26  be invoked due to an actuarial deficiency, either during the ongoing operation or due to the \\ntermination of the  Fund , deficiency payments required from each member organization would be based upon the \\nproportion of that member organization’s contributions to the total contributions paid to the Fund during the three \\nyears preceding the valuation date.  Total contributions paid to the Fund  during  the preceding three years (2017, \\n2018 and 2019 ) amounted to 7,546.9  million  US dollars , of which 1.77 per cent was  contributed by WIPO (including \\nparticipants and Organization contributions) . \\n \\nDuring 2020 , WIPO contributions  (including Organization contributions only) paid to the Fund amounted to 29.0 \\nmillio n Swiss francs (29.2  million Swiss francs  in 2019 ). Expected contributions due in 2021  are approximately 28.1 \\nmillion  Swiss francs.  \\n \\nMembership of the Fund may be terminated by decision of the United Nations General Assembly, upon the \\naffirmative recomm endation of the Pension Board. A proportionate share of the total assets of the Fund at the date \\nof termination shall be paid to the former member organization  for the exclusive benefit of its staff who were \\nparticipants in the Fund at that date, pursuant to an arrangement mutually agreed between the orga nization and \\nthe Fund. The amount is determined b y the  Pension Board based on an actuarial valuation of the a ssets and \\nliabilities of the Fund on the date of termination; no part of the assets which are in excess of the liabilities is  included \\nin the amount.  \\n \\nThe United Nations Board of Auditors carries out an annual audit of the Fund  and reports to the Pension B oard and \\nto the United Nations General Assembly  on the audit every year. The Fund  publishes quarterly reports on its \\ninvestments and these can be viewed by visiting the Fund  at www.unjspf.org . \\n \\n  '),\n",

The following \\nmethods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Cash and short -term deposits, receivables from exchange transactions, accounts payable and other current \\nliabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short -term maturities of these instruments;  \\n\\uf0b7 Quoted investments (in investment funds which are publicly traded) are based on price quotations at the \\nreporting date;  \\n\\uf0b7 Derivative financial instruments are b ased on quoted prices, adjusted for the UNORE at reporting date;  \\n\\uf0b7 Loans and  receivables are evaluated by the Organization based on parameters such as interest rates and risk \\ncharacteristics.  \\n \\nFor WIPO’s financial assets and liabilities at the reporting date , the carrying amount is equivalent to the fair value.  \\n \\nFair V alue Hierarchy  \\n \\nFor those instruments categorized as fair value through surplus or deficit, fair values are classified according to the \\nfollowing hierarchy:  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active  markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1);  \\n\\uf0b7 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either \\ndirectly or indirectly (Level 2);  \\n\\uf0b7 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based o n observable market data (Level 3).  \\n \\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Fair Value Hierarchy\\nCash and cash equivalents Level 1\\nDerivative assets and liabilities Level 2\\nInvestments arising from core and strategic cash Level 1\\n \\nCredit Risk  \\n \\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Organization if counterparties to financial instruments fail to meet their \\ncontractual obligations, and it arises principally from the Organiz ation’s loans , receivables, cash and cash \\nequivalents , and investments . The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. \\nFor the purposes of financial reporting, WIPO calculates expected credit losses allowances associated with its \\nfinanc ial assets.  \\n \\nThe Organization’s receivables from non -exchange transactions are almost exclusively from its Member States \\nrepresenting sovereign governments, and therefore risks related to credit are considered minor. An allowance has \\nbeen established again st the asset value of accounts receivable to reflect receivables for which payment is not \\nanticipated in the short -term.  The allowance covers amounts due from Member States that have lost the right to \\nvote under Article 11, paragraph 5 of the WIPO Conventi on and contributions from least developed countries which \\nhave been frozen by action of the Assemblies  in 1989 and 1991.  \\n \\nIn accordance with the Organization’s Policy on Investments, deposits may only be held  with institutions with a \\nminimum short -term credit rating of A -2/P-2 or a minimum long -term credit rating of A/A2. Money market \\ninvestments, bonds, notes or other obligations and other fixed income products purchased directly by WIPO may \\nonly be held with  institutions with a minimum short -term credit rating of A -3/P-3 or a minimum long -term credit rating \\nof BBB -/Baa3. Where these are acquired as shares in pooled market traded funds, at least 65 per cent of the  \\nportfolio  holdings must be in Investment Grade  (AAA/Aaa to BBB -/Baa3), while the balance of up to 35 per cent \\nmay be held in high yield bonds (BB+/Ba1 to C/Ca). The credit ratings attached to cash and cash equivalents and \\ninvestments as at December 31, 2020 , is as follows : \\n '),\n",

Non -current investments held by WIPO are in investment funds which are \\nnot rated by credit rating agencies, but in which the underlying investments are made in accordan ce with WIPO’s Policy on Investments.  \\n \\nLiquidity Risk  \\n \\nLiquidity risk is the risk of the Organization not being able to meet its obligations as they fall due . \\n \\nThe Organization does not have significant exposure to liquidity risk as it has substantial unrestricted cash \\nresources which are replenis hed from the results of its operations. The Organization’s Policy on Investments \\nrequires that operating and core cash are invested in such a way to ensure the liquidity necessary to meet the \\nOrganization’s cash flow requirements. Operating cash balances a re invested over the short term (periods not \\nexceeding twelve months to maturity) in low -risk asset classes which are easily liquidated at  little or no cost. Core \\ncash  balances are  invested with the objective of generating a positive return over rolling fi ve year periods . Core \\ncash balances are invested ideally in such a way that occasional access to a portion of the cash is possible.  \\nStrategic cash  balances are  invested over the long term, and currently have  no short or medium term liquidity \\nrequirements.  \\n \\nCurrency Risk  \\n \\nThe Organization receives revenue from fees in currencies and incurs expenses in currencies other than its \\nfunctional currency, the Swiss franc, and is exposed  to foreign currency exchange risk arising from fluctuations of \\ncurrency exchange rates. For PCT international filing fees, WIPO establishes equivalent amounts in currencies \\nother than the Swiss franc, which can be reset during the year if the exchange rat e between the other currency and \\nSwiss franc is 5.0 per cent or more for more than four consecutive Fridays. The Organization is also exposed to \\nexchange risk arising from the currency differences between amounts payable to International Searching Authorit ies \\n(ISAs)  pursuant to the Regulations under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and amounts received by national patent \\noffices for international search fees from applicants for international patents.  The Organization  also operates  the \\nWIPO Fee Transfer Service , a netting structure  that reduce s the exposure of PCT fee income to movements in \\ncurrency exchange rates  with regard to search fees.  \\n \\nWhere investments are held in currencies other than the Swiss franc , the Organization may use derivative financial \\ninstru ments to minimize the risk arising from the fluctuation of the currency of the investment against the Swiss \\nfranc . Investment in derivatives for speculative purposes is not permitted.  As at December 31, 2020, the \\nOrganization held US dollar investments totalling 105.9  million  Swiss francs. The sensitivity of these investments \\nto exchange rate fluctuations is monitored, and derivative financial instruments are used to minimize this risk.  \\n \\nThe Organization’s contributions to the UNJSPF and its payments to ICC are made in US dollars. The Organization \\nhas a further exposure to exchange risk  in connection with the cost of pensions for staff  previously enrolled in the \\nClosed Pension Fund who are now members of the UNJSPF. In addition, the Organization has external offices in \\nAlgeria, Brazil, China, Japan, Nigeria, Russia and  Singapore , and a coordination office in the USA,  with limited \\nassets in local currency . \\n \\nMarket  Risk  \\n \\nMarket risk is the ri sk of changes in market prices, including in terest rates, affecting the Organization’s income or \\nthe value of its financial instrument holdings. Investmen t revenue in the Organization’s  budget for  the 2020/21  \\nProgram and Budget  is limited to interest on op erating cash balances . The Organization does not currently use \\nfinancial instruments to hedge interest rate risk.  WIPO’s medium -term investment portfolio (core cash) and long -\\nterm investment portfolio (strategic cash) are subject to the risk of movements in market prices of the underlying \\ninvestment funds. Based on historical experience for the investment strategies applied to these portfolios, the \\nexpected volatility for cor e cash and strategic cash is 3.40 per cent and 5.3 0 per cent respectively.  \\n \\n \\n  '),\n",

In 2024, our vehicle volume growth rate may be notably \\nlower than the growth rate achieved in 2023, as our teams work on the launch of the next generation vehicle and other \\nproducts. In 2024, the growth rates of energy storage deployments and revenue in our Energy Generation and Storage \\nbusiness should outpace the Automotive business.\\nCash We have sufficient liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long -term capacity expansion plans and other expenses. \\nFurthermore, we will manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period.\\nProfit While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect \\nour hardware -related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet -based profits.\\nProduct We have updated our future vehicle line -upto accelerate the launch ofnew models ahead of our previously \\ncommunicated start of production in the second half of 2025.\\nThese new vehicles, including more affordable models, will utilize aspects of the next generation platform as well as \\naspects of our current platforms, and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle \\nline-up. \\nThis update may result in achieving less cost reduction than previously expected butenables us to prudently grow our \\nvehicle volumes in a more capex efficient manner during uncertain times. This would help us fully utilize our current \\nexpected maximum capacity of close to three million vehicles, enabling more than 50% growth over 2023 production \\nbefore investing in new manufacturing lines. \\nOur purpose -built robotaxi product will continue to pursue a revolutionary “unboxed” manufacturing strategy.'),\n",

This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year \\nthereafter.\\nCERTAIN  TERMS\\nWhen  used  in this update,  certain  terms  have  the following  meanings.  Our vehicle  deliveries  include  only vehicles  that have  been  transferred  to end customers  with all paperwork  correctly  completed . Our energy  product  \\ndeployment  volume  includes  both  customer  units  installed  and equipment  sales ; we report  installations  at time of commissioning  for storage  projects  or inspection  for solar  projects,  and equipment  sales  at time of delivery . \\n\"Adjusted  EBITDA\" is equal  to (i) net income  (loss)  attributable  to common  stockholders  before  (ii)(a) interest  expense,  (b) provision  for income  taxes,  (c) depreciation,  amortization  and impairment  and (d) stock -based  \\ncompensation  expense . \"Free  cash  flow\"  is operating  cash  flow less capital  expenditures . Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive  sales  divided by new vehicle  deliveries (excluding  operating  leases) . “Days  sales \\noutstanding”  is equal  to (i) average accounts  receivable,  net for the period divided by (ii) total  revenues and multiplied  by (iii) the number  of days  in the period. “Days  payable  outstanding”  is equal  to (i) average accounts  \\npayable  for the period divided by (ii) total  cost of revenues  and multiplied  by (iii) the number  of days  in the period . “Days  of supply”  is calculated  by dividing  new car ending  inventory  by the relevant  quarter’s deliveries  and \\nusing  75 trading  days .Constant currency  impacts are calculated  by comparing  actuals against  current results converted  into USD using  average exchange rates  from  the prior period.\\nNON -GAAP  FINANCIAL  INFORMATION\\nConsolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non -GAAP basis to supplement our c onsolidated financial results. Our non -GAAP financial measures include non -GAAP net income \\n(loss) attributable to common stockholders, non -GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per shar e basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) \\nattributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non- GAAP financial measu res also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as \\nwell as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP  financial statements with this non- GAAP information because management uses such information \\ninternally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the no n-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial \\ncondition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important finan cial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s \\nperformance. Non -GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be re ad in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding \\nTesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non -GAAP financial information is provided above.\\nFORWARD -LOOKING  STATEMENTS\\nCertain statements in this update, including statements in the “Outlook” section; statements relating to the future developme nt, strategy, ramp, production and capacity, demand and market growth, cost, pricing and profitability, \\ninvestment, deliveries, deployment, availability and other features and improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products; statements regarding operating margin, operating profits, spending and liquidity; and \\nstatements regarding expansion, improvements and/or ramp and related timing at our factories are “forward -looking statements” that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward -looking statements are based on \\nmanagement’s current expectations, and as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially f rom those projected. The following important factors, without limitation, could cause actual results to \\ndiffer materially from those in the forward -looking statements: the risk of delays in launching and manufacturing our products a nd features cost -effectively; our ability to grow our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and \\ncharging capabilities and effectively manage this growth; consumers’ demand for electric vehicles generally and our vehicles specifically; the ability of suppliers to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and \\nvolumes acceptable to us, and our ability to manage such components effectively; any issues with lithium- ion cells or other comp onents manufactured at our factories; our ability to ramp our factories in accordance with our \\nplans; our ability to procure supply of battery cells, including through our own manufacturing; risks relating to international expansion; any failures by Tesla products to perform as expected or if product recalls occur; the risk of \\nproduct liability claims; competition in the automotive and energy product markets; our ability to maintain public credibilit y and confidence in our long -term business prospects; our ability to manage risks relating to our various \\nproduct financing programs; the status of government and economic incentives for electric vehicles and energy products; our abil ity to attract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel; our ability to maintain the \\nsecurity of our information and production and product systems; our compliance with various regulations and laws applicable t o our operations and products, which may evolve from time to time; risks relating to our \\nindebtedness and financing strategies; and adverse foreign exchange movements. More information on potential factors that cou ld affect our financial results is included from time to time in our Securities and Exchange \\nCommission filings and reports, including the risks identified under the section captioned “Risk Factors” in our annual repor t on Form 10 -K filed with the SEC on January 26, 2024. Tesla disclaims any obligation to update \\ninformation contained in these forward -looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\\n30\\n'),\n",

Our non- GAAP financial measures include non- GAAP net income \\n(loss) attributable to common stockholders, non -GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per shar e basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) \\nattributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non- GAAP financial measu res also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as \\nwell as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non- GAAP information because management uses such information \\ninternally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the no n-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial \\ncondition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s \\nperformance. Non -GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be re ad in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding \\nTesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non- GAAP financial information is provided above.\\nFORWARD -LOOKING STATEMENTS\\nCertain statements in this update, including statements in the “Outlook” section; statements relating to the future developme nt,ramp, production and capacity, demand and market growth, cost, pricing and profitability, \\ninvestment, deliveries, deployment, availability and other features and improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products and technologies such as Model 3, Model Y, Model X, Model S, Cybertruck, Tesla Semi, our \\nnext generation vehicle platform, our Dojo training computers, our Autopilot, Full Self -Driving and other vehicle software and A I enabled products, our battery cells, our Supercharging network, our energy storage and solar \\nproducts and our financing products; statements regarding operating margin, operating profits, spending and liquidity; and state ments regarding expansion, improvements and/or ramp and related timing at our factories are \\n“forward -looking statements” that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward -looking statements are based on management’s current expectations, and as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, actual results may \\ndiffer materially from those projected. The following important factors, without limitation, could cause actual results to di ffer materially from those in the forward -looking statements: uncertainties in future macroeconomic and \\nregulatory conditions arising from the current global pandemic; the risk of delays in launching and manufacturing our products a nd features cost- effectively; our ability to grow our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and \\ncharging capabilities and effectively manage this growth; consumers’ demand for electric vehicles generally and our vehicles spe cifically; the ability of suppliers to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and \\nvolumes acceptable to us, and our ability to manage such components effectively; any issues with lithium -ion cells or other comp onents manufactured at our factories; our ability to ramp our factories in accordance with our \\nplans; our ability to procure supply of battery cells, including through our own manufacturing; risks relating to international expansion; any failures by Tesla products to perform as expected or if product recalls occur; the risk of \\nproduct liability claims; competition in the automotive and energy product markets; our ability to maintain public credibility a nd confidence in our long -term business prospects; our ability to manage risks relating to our various \\nproduct financing programs; the status of government and economic incentives for electric vehicles and energy products; our a bility to attract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel and ramp our installation \\nteams; our ability to maintain the security of our information and production and product systems; our compliance with various r egulations and laws applicable to our operations and products, which may evolve from time to \\ntime; risks relating to our indebtedness and financing strategies; and adverse foreign exchange movements. More information o n potential factors that could affect our financial results is included from time to time in our \\nSecurities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including the risks identified under the section captioned “Risk Fact ors” in our annual report on Form 10 -K filed with the SEC on January 31, 2023.

We \\nbelieve that a pure EV is the optimal vehicle design and will ultimately win over consumers as \\nthe myths on range, charging and service are debunked.\\nProgress continued for our AI initiatives in Q2. We reduced the price of FSD (Supervised)4 in \\nNorth America and launched free trials to everyone with the necessary hardware. These \\nprograms have demonstrated success and are laying the foundation for more meaningful FSD \\nmonetization. We expect to see an increase in FSD attach rates for our fleet as the capability \\nimproves and we increase  awareness of the convenience and safety it offers users.\\nOverall, our focus remains on company -wide cost reduction, including reducing COGS per \\nvehicle, growing our traditional hardware business and accelerating development of our AI -\\nenabled products and services.

This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year thereafter.\\nCERTAIN  TERMS\\nWhen used in this update,  certain  terms  have  the following  meanings . Our vehicle  deliveries  include  only  vehicles  that have  been transferred  to end customers  with  all paperwork  correctly  completed.  Our energy  product  deployment  volume  includes  \\nboth customer  units  when installed  and equipment  sales  at time  of delivery . \"Adjusted EBITDA\"  is equal  to (i) net income  (loss)  attributable  to common  stockholders  before  (ii)(a) interest  expense,  (b) provision  for income  taxes,  (c) depreciation,  \\namortization  and impairment  and (d) stock -based compensation  expense . \"Free  cash  flow\"  is operating  cash  flow  less capital  expenditures . Average  cost per vehicle  is cost of automotive  sales  divided  by new  vehicle  deliveries  (excluding  operating  leases) . \\n“Days  sales  outstanding”  is equal  to (i) average  accounts  receivable, net for the period divided  by (ii) total  revenues  and multiplied by (iii) the number  of days  in the period.  “Days  payable  outstanding”  is equal  to (i) average  accounts  payable  for the \\nperiod divided by (ii) total  cost of revenues  and multiplied by (iii) the number  of days  in the period.  “Days  of supply”  is calculated  by dividing  new  car ending  inventory  by the relevant  quarter’s  deliveries  and using  75 trading  days .Constant  currency  \\nimpacts  are calculated by comparing  actuals  against  current  results  converted  into USD  using  average  exchange  rates  from  the prior  period.\\nNON- GAAP  FINANCIAL  INFORMATION\\nConsolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non- GAAP basis to supplement our c onsolidated financial results. Our non- GAAP financial measures include non- GAAP net income (loss) attributable to \\ncommon stockholders, non- GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated usi ng weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, \\nAdjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non- GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons t o Tesla’s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management \\nbelieves that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non- GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that \\npresentation of the non -GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition a nd results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial \\nmetrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s performance. Non- GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with \\nfinancial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Tesla’s operating performance.

Our non- GAAP financial measures include non- GAAP net income \\n(loss) attributable to common stockholders, non -GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per shar e basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) \\nattributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non- GAAP financial measu res also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as \\nwell as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non- GAAP information because management uses such information \\ninternally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the no n-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial \\ncondition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s \\nperformance. Non -GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be re ad in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding \\nTesla’s operating performance.

This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year \\nthereafter.\\nCERTAIN  TERMS\\nWhen  used  in this update,  certain  terms have  the following  meanings . Our vehicle  deliveries  include  only vehicles  that have  been  transferred  to end customers with all paperwork  correctly  completed . Our energy  product  \\ndeployment  volume  includes  both  customer  units  installed  and equipment  sales;  we report  installations  at time of commissioning  for storage  projects  or inspection for solar  projects,  and equipment  sales at time of delivery . \\n\"Adjusted  EBITDA\"  is equal  to (i) net income  (loss)  attributable  to common  stockholders  before  (ii)(a) interest  expense,  (b) provision  for income  taxes,  (c) depreciation,  amortization  and impairment  and (d) stock -based  \\ncompensation  expense . \"Free  cash  flow\"  is operating  cash  flow less capital  expenditures . Average  cost per vehicle  is cost of automotive  sales  divided by new vehicle  deliveries  (excluding  operating  leases) . “Days  sales  \\noutstanding”  is equal  to (i) average  accounts  receivable,  net for the period divided by (ii) total  revenues  and multiplied  by (iii) the number  of days  in the period. “Days  payable  outstanding”  is equal  to (i) average  accounts  \\npayable  for the period divided by (ii) total  cost of revenues  and multiplied  by (iii) the number  of days  in the period. “Days  of supply”  is calculated  by dividing new car ending  inventory  by the relevant  quarter’s  deliveries  and \\nusing  75 trading  days .Constant currency  impacts  are calculated  by comparing actuals  against  current results  converted  into USD using  average  exchange  rates  from  the prior period.\\nNON -GAAP  FINANCIAL  INFORMATION\\nConsolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non- GAAP basis to supplement our c onsolidated financial results. Our non- GAAP financial measures include non- GAAP net income \\n(loss) attributable to common stockholders, non -GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per shar e basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) \\nattributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non- GAAP financial measu res also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as \\nwell as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP  financial statements with this non- GAAP information because management uses such information \\ninternally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the no n-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial \\ncondition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s \\nperformance. Non -GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be re ad in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding \\nTesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non- GAAP financial information is provided above.\\nFORWARD -LOOKING  STATEMENTS\\nCertain statements in this update, including statements in the “Outlook” section; statements relating to the future developme nt, ramp, production and capacity, demand and market growth, cost, pricing and profitability, \\ninvestment, deliveries, deployment, availability and other features and improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products; statements regarding operating margin, operating profits, spending and liquidity; and \\nstatements regarding expansion, improvements and/or ramp and related timing at our factories are “forward -looking statements” that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward -looking statements are based on \\nmanagement’s current expectations, and as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially f rom those projected. The following important factors, without limitation, could cause actual results to \\ndiffer materially from those in the forward -looking statements: the risk of delays in launching and manufacturing our products a nd features cost- effectively; our ability to grow our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and \\ncharging capabilities and effectively manage this growth; consumers’ demand for electric vehicles generally and our vehicles spe cifically; the ability of suppliers to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and \\nvolumes acceptable to us, and our ability to manage such components effectively; any issues with lithium -ion cells or other comp onents manufactured at our factories; our ability to ramp our factories in accordance with our \\nplans; our ability to procure supply of battery cells, including through our own manufacturing; risks relating to international expansion; any failures by Tesla products to perform as expected or if product recalls occur; the risk of \\nproduct liability claims; competition in the automotive and energy product markets; our ability to maintain public credibility a nd confidence in our long -term business prospects; our ability to manage risks relating to our various \\nproduct financing programs; the status of government and economic incentives for electric vehicles and energy products; our a bility to attract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel; our ability to maintain the \\nsecurity of our information and production and product systems; our compliance with various regulations and laws applicable t o our operations and products, which may evolve from time to time; risks relating to our \\nindebtedness and financing strategies; and adverse foreign exchange movements. More information on potential factors that could affect our financial results is included from time to time in our Securities and Exchange \\nCommission filings and reports, including the risks identified under the section captioned “Risk Factors” in our annual repor t on Form 10 -K filed with the SEC on January 31, 2023. Tesla disclaims any obligation to update \\ninformation contained in these forward -looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\\n31\\n'),\n",

Many \\nof these risk factors are not within the company’s control and could adversely affect our business, \\nour financial and operating results, or our financial condition. These risk factors include:  \\n \\nSupply and Demand  \\nThe oil, gas, and petro chemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses. This means \\nExxonMobil’s operations and earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas, and \\npetrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products. Oil, gas, petrochemica l, and \\nproduct prices and margins in turn depend on local, regional, and global events or conditions that \\naffect supply and demand for the relevant commodity or product. Any material decline in oil or natural \\ngas prices could have a material adverse effect  on the company’s operations, financial condition, and \\nproved reserves, especially in the Upstream segment. On the other hand, a material increase in oil or \\nnatural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations, especially in the \\nEnergy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products segments. Our pursuit of lower -\\nemission business opportunities including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, lower -emission \\nfuels, and lithium also depends on the growth and development of ma rkets for those products and \\nservices, including implementation of supportive government policies and developments in \\ntechnology to enable those products and services to be provided on a cost -effective basis at \\ncommercial scale. See \"Climate Change and the  Energy Transition\" below . \\nEconomic conditions . The demand for energy and petrochemicals is generally linked closely with \\nbroad -based economic activities and levels of prosperity. The occurrence of recessions or other \\nperiods of low or negat ive economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results. \\nOther factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as \\nchanges in population growth rates, periods of civil unrest, government regulat ion or austerity \\nprograms, trade tariffs or broader breakdowns in global trade, security or public health issues and \\nresponses, or currency exchange rate fluctuations, can also impact the demand for energy and \\npetrochemicals. Sovereign debt downgrades, def aults, inability to access debt markets due to rating, \\nbanking, or legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or restructuring of fiscal, monetary, or \\npolitical systems such as the European Union, and other events or conditions that impair the \\nfuncti oning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to ExxonMobil, including risks to the \\nsafety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their \\ncommitments to ExxonMobil. Our future business results, inclu ding cash flows and financing needs, \\nmay also be affected by the occurrence, severity, pace and rate of recovery of future public health \\nepidemics or pandemics; the responsive actions taken by governments and others; and the resulting \\neffects on regional a nd global markets and economies.  \\nOther demand -related factors . Other factors that may affect the demand for oil, gas, petrochemicals \\nor our other products, and therefore impact our results, include technological improvements in '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\financial_reports_2024_08_06\\\\Energy\\\\ExxonMobil\\\\2023_FAFRs_final.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='2 \\n energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns; increased competitiveness of, or government policy \\nsupport for, alternative energy sources; changes in technology that alter fuel choices, such as \\ntechnological advances in energy storage or other critical areas that make wind, solar, hyd rogen, \\nnuclear or other alternatives more competitive for power generation; changes in consumer \\npreferences for our products, including consumer demand for alternative -fueled or electric \\ntransportation or alternatives to plastic products; and broad -based c hanges in personal income \\nlevels. See also “Climate Change and the Energy Transition” below.  \\nOther supply -related factors . Commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of \\nfactors affecting supply. For example, increased supply from the deve lopment of new oil and gas \\nsupply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tends to reduce \\ncommodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in \\ndemand. Similarly, increases in industry refi ning or petrochemical manufacturing capacity relative to \\ndemand tend to reduce margins on the affected products. World oil, gas, and petrochemical supply \\nlevels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies, such as the level of and adhere nce \\nby participating countries to production quotas established by OPEC or \"OPEC+\" and other \\nagreements among sovereigns; government policies, including actions intended to reduce \\ngreenhouse gas emissions, that restrict oil and gas production or increase a ssociated costs; the \\noccurrence of wars or hostile actions, including disruption of land or sea transportation routes; \\nnatural disasters; disruptions in competitors’ operations; and logistics constraints or unexpected \\nunavailability of distribution channel s that may disrupt supplies. Technological change can also alter \\nthe relative costs for competitors to find, produce  and refine oil and gas , and to manufacture \\npetrochemicals.  \\nOther market factors . ExxonMobil’s business results are also exposed to potenti al negative impacts \\ndue to changes in interest rates, inflation, currency exchange rates, changes in usage of the U.S. \\ndollar in global trade, and other local or regional market conditions. In addition to direct potential \\nimpacts on our costs and revenues,  market factors such as rates of inflation may indirectly impact our \\nresults to the extent such factors reduce general rates of economic growth and therefore energy \\ndemand, as discussed under “Economic conditions”. Market factors may also result in losses from \\ncommodity derivatives and other instruments we use to hedge price exposures or for trading \\npurposes. Additional information regarding the potential future impact of market factors on our \\nbusinesses is included or incorporated by reference under \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative \\nDisclosures About Market Risk\" in ExxonMobil’s 2023 Form 10 -K. \\n \\nGovernment and Political Factors  \\nExxonMobil’s results can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our \\noperations.  \\nAccess limitations . A number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources, including by \\nrestricting leasing or permitting activities, or may place resources off -limits from development \\naltogether. Restrictions on production of oil a nd gas could increase to the extent governments view \\nsuch measures as a viable approach for pursuing national and global energy and climate policies. \\nRestrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high '),\n",

Many countries also restrict the import or export of certain products based on point of origin.   \\nRestrictions on doing business . ExxonMobil is subject to laws and  sanctions imposed by the United \\nStates or by other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit ExxonMobil or its affiliates \\nfrom doing business in certain countries or restrict the kind of business that may be conducted, \\nincluding acquiring or di vesting certain assets. Such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage \\nto competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions.   \\nLack of legal certainty . Some countries in which we do business lack well -developed legal systems, \\nhave not yet  adopted or may be unable to maintain clear regulatory frameworks, or may have \\nevolving and unharmonized standards that vary or conflict across jurisdictions. Lack of legal certainty \\nexposes us to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by gover nment officials, and also \\nmakes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts. In some cases, these risks can be partially \\noffset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum, but the adequacy of this remedy \\nmay still depend on the loc al legal system to enforce an award.  \\nRegulatory and litigation risks . Even in countries with well -developed legal systems where \\nExxonMobil does business, we remain exposed to changes in law or interpretation of settled law \\n(including changes that result fr om international treaties and accords) and changes in policy that \\ncould adversely affect our results, such as:  \\n• increases in taxes, duties, or government royalty rates (including retroactive claims or punitive \\ntaxes on oil, gas and petrochemical operations) ; \\n• price controls;  \\n• changes in environmental regulations or other laws that increase our cost of operation or \\ncompliance or reduce or delay available business opportunities (including changes in laws \\naffecting offshore drilling operations, standards to compl ete decommissioning, water use, \\nemissions, hydraulic fracturing, or production or use of new or recycled plastics, as well as \\nlaws and regulations affecting trading);  \\n• actions by policy -makers, regulators, or other actors to delay or deny necessary licenses  and \\npermits, restrict the availability of oil and gas leases or the transportation or export of our \\nproducts, or otherwise require changes in the company's business or strategy that could \\nresult in reduced returns;  \\n• regulatory interpretations that exclude or disfavor our products under government policies \\nor programs intended to support new or developing markets or technologies, or that \\notherwise are not technology -neutral;  \\n• adoption of regulations mandating efficiency standards, the use of alternative fuels  or \\nuncompetitive fuel components;  \\n• adoption of disclosure regulations that could create competitive disadvantages, require us to \\nincur disproportionate costs, or increase legal risk due to a need to rely on uncertain \\nestimates or extrapolations (such as em issions of third parties) and lack of uniform standards \\nacross jurisdictions, or by requiring us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial \\ninformation or to violate the non -disclosure laws of other countries; and  \\n• government actions to cancel contracts , redenominate the official currency, renounce or \\ndefault on obligations, renegotiate terms unilaterally, or expropriate assets.  \"),\n",

The continued \\nadoption of similar legal practices in the European Union or elsewhere would broaden this risk and \\nhas b egun to be applied to some of our competitors in the European Union.  \\nSecurity concerns . Successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by civil \\nunrest, acts of sabotage or terrorism, cybersecurity attacks, the application of nat ional security laws \\nor policies that result in restricting our ability to do business in a particular jurisdiction, and other local \\nsecurity concerns. Such concerns may be directed specifically at our company, our industry, or as part \\nof broader movements and may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down \\noperations for a period of time.  \\n \\nClimate Change and the Energy Transition  \\nNet-zero scenarios . Driven by concern over the risks of climate change, a number of countries have \\nadopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas \\nemissions including emissions from the production and use of oil and gas and their products as well \\nas the use or support for different emission -reduction technolog ies. These actions are being taken \\nboth independently by national and regional governments and within the framework of United \\nNations Conference of the Parties summits under which many countries of the world have endorsed \\nobjectives to reduce the atmospher ic concentration of carbon dioxide (CO 2) over the coming \\ndecades, with an ambition ultimately to achieve “net zero”. Net zero means that emissions of \\ngreenhouse gases from human activities would be balanced by actions that remove such gases from \\nthe atmosp here. Expectations for transition of the world’s energy system to lower -emission sources, \\nand ultimately net -zero, derive from hypothetical scenarios that reflect many assumptions about the \\nfuture and reflect substantial uncertainties. The company’s object ive to play a leading role in the \\nenergy transition, including the company’s announced ambition ultimately to achieve net zero with \\nrespect to Scope 1 and 2 emissions from operations with continued technology development and \\npolicy support where ExxonMobil  is the operator, carries risks that the transition, including underlying \\ntechnologies, policies, and markets as discussed in more detail below, will not be available or develop \\nat the pace or in the manner expected by current net -zero scenarios. The succe ss of our strategy for \\nthe energy transition will also depend on our ability to recognize key signposts of changes in the \\nglobal energy system on a timely basis, and our corresponding ability to direct investment to the \\ntechnologies and businesses, at the appropriate stage of development, to best capitalize on our \\ncompetitive strengths.  \\nGreenhouse gas restrictions . Government actions intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \\ninclude adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, carbon -based import duti es or other trade '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\financial_reports_2024_08_06\\\\Energy\\\\ExxonMobil\\\\2023_FAFRs_final.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='5 \\n tariffs, minimum renewable usage requirements, restrictive permitting, increased mileage and other \\nefficiency standards, mandates for sales of electric vehicles, mandates for use of specific fuels or \\ntechnologies, and other incentives or mandates designed to support certain technologies for \\ntransitioning to lower -emission energy sources. Political and other actors and their agents also \\nincreasingly seek to advance climate change objectives indirectly, such as by seeking to reduce the \\navail ability or increase the cost of financing and investment in the oil and gas sector. These actions \\ninclude delaying or blocking needed infrastructure, utilizing shareholder governance mechanisms \\nagainst companies or their shareholders or financial instituti ons in an effort to deter investment in oil \\nand gas activities, and taking other actions intended to promote changes in business strategy for oil \\nand gas companies. Depending on how policies are formulated and applied, such policies could \\nnegatively affect  our investment returns, make our hydrocarbon -based products more expensive or \\nless competitive, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as \\nwell as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower -carbon alternatives. Cur rent and pending \\ngreenhouse gas regulations or policies may also increase our compliance costs, such as for \\nmonitoring or sequestering emissions.  \\nTechnology and lower -emission solutions . Achieving societal ambitions to reduce greenhouse gas \\nemissions and u ltimately achieve net zero will require new technologies to reduce the cost and \\nincrease the scalability of alternative energy sources, as well as technologies such as carbon capture \\nand storage (CCS). CCS technologies, focused initially on capturing and s equestering CO 2 emissions \\nfrom high -intensity industrial activities, can assist in meeting society’s objective to mitigate \\natmospheric greenhouse gas levels while also helping ensure the availability of the reliable and \\naffordable energy the world requires . ExxonMobil has established a Low Carbon Solutions (LCS) \\nbusiness unit to advance the development and deployment of these technologies and projects, \\nincluding CCS, hydrogen, lower -emission fuels, and lithium, breakthrough energy efficiency \\nprocesses, adva nced energy -saving materials, and other technologies. The company’s efforts include \\nboth in -house research and development as well as collaborative efforts with leading universities and \\nwith commercial partners involved in advanced lower -emission energy te chnologies. Our future \\nresults and ability to grow our LCS business, help nations meet their emission -reduction goals, and \\nsucceed through the energy transition will depend in part on the success of these research and \\ncollaboration efforts and on our abili ty to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model \\nto providing the energy products of the future in a cost -competitive manner.  \\nPolicy and market development . The scale of the world’s energy system means that, in addition to \\ndevelopments in technology as discussed above, a successful energy transition will require \\nappropriate support from governments and private participants throughout the global economy. Our \\nability to develop and deploy CCS and other lower -emission energy technologies at co mmercial \\nscale, and the growth and future returns of LCS and other emerging businesses in which we invest, \\nwill depend in part on the continued development of supportive government policies and markets. \\nFailure or delay of these policies or markets to mate rialize or be maintained could adversely impact \\nthese investments. Policy and other actions that result in restricting the availability of hydrocarbon \\nproducts without commensurate reduction in demand may have unpredictable adverse effects, \\nincluding incre ased commodity price volatility; periods of significantly higher commodity prices and \\nresulting inflationary pressures; and local or regional energy shortages. Such effects in turn may \\ndepress economic growth or lead to rapid or conflicting shifts in polic y by different actors, with '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\financial_reports_2024_08_06\\\\Energy\\\\ExxonMobil\\\\2023_FAFRs_final.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='6 \\n resulting adverse effects on our businesses. In addition, the existence of supportive policies in any \\njurisdiction is not a guarantee that those policies will continue in the future. See also the discussion \\nof “Supply and Demand ,” “Government and Political Factors,” and “Operational and Other Factors .” \\n \\nOperational and Other Factors  \\nIn addition to external economic and political factors, our future business results also depend on our \\nability to manage successful ly those factors that are, at least in part, within our control, including our \\ncapital allocation into existing and new businesses. The extent to which we manage these factors will \\nimpact our performance relative to competition. For projects in which we ar e not the operator, we \\ndepend on the management effectiveness of one or more co -venturers whom we do not control.  \\nExploration and development program . Our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production \\ndepends on the success of our exploration and  development efforts. Among other factors, we must \\ncontinuously improve our ability to identify the most promising resource prospects and apply our \\nproject management expertise to bring discovered resources online as scheduled and within budget.  \\nProject an d portfolio management . The long -term success of ExxonMobil’s Upstream and Product \\nSolutions businesses, as well as the future success of LCS and other emerging lower -emission \\ninvestments, depends on complex, long -term, capital -intensive projects. These pr ojects in turn \\nrequire a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency. Specific factors that \\ncan affect the performance of major projects include our ability to: negotiate successfully with joint \\nventurers, partners, governments, supp liers, customers, or others; model and optimize reservoir \\nperformance; develop markets for project outputs, whether through long -term contracts or the \\ndevelopment of effective spot markets; qualify for certain incentives available under supportive \\ngovernme nt policies for emerging markets and technologies; manage changes in operating \\nconditions and costs, including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and \\nshipping, supply -chain disruptions, and inflationary cost pressures; prevent , to the extent possible, \\nand respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project start -up or cause \\nunscheduled project downtime; and influence the performance of project operators where \\nExxonMobil does not perform that role. In addition to the effective management of individual \\nprojects, ExxonMobil’s success, including our ability to mitigate risk and provide attractive returns to \\nshareholders, depends on our ability to successfully manage our overall portfolio, including \\ndive rsification among types and locations of our projects, products produced, and strategies to \\nacquire or divest assets. We may not be able to divest assets at a price or on the timeline we \\ncontemplate in our strategies. Additionally, we may retain certain li abilities following a divestment \\nand could be held liable for past use or for different liabilities than anticipated.  \\nThe term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not \\nnecessarily have the same meaning as  in any government payment transparency reports.  \\nOperational efficiency . An important component of ExxonMobil’s competitive performance, \\nespecially given the commodity -based nature of many of our businesses, is our ability to operate \\nefficiently, including our ability to manage expenses, improve production yields on an ongoing basis \\nand successfully integrate and achieve the anticipated synergies of acquisitions, including the '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\financial_reports_2024_08_06\\\\Energy\\\\ExxonMobil\\\\2023_FAFRs_final.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='7 \\n acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources Company. This requires continuous management focus, \\nincluding technology integration and improvements, cost contr ol, productivity enhancements, \\nharmonizing the functions, policies, procedures and processes, regular reappraisal of our asset \\nportfolio, and the recruitment, development, and retention of high caliber employees.   \\nResearch and development and technological  change . To maintain our competitive position, \\nespecially in light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous efficiency \\nimprovement, ExxonMobil’s technology, research, and development organizations must be \\nsuccessful and abl e to adapt to a changing market and policy environment, including continuous \\nimprovement in the efficiency of hydraulic fracturing technology and developing technologies to help \\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions. To remain competitive, we must also continuou sly adapt and \\ncapture the benefits of new and emerging technologies, including successfully applying advances in \\nthe ability to process very large amounts of data to our businesses.  \\nSafety, business controls, and environmental risk management . Our results depend on \\nmanagement’s ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil, gas, and petrochemical operations, to \\neffectively control our business activities, including trading, and to minimize the potential for human \\nerror. We apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus on workplace safety and \\navoiding spills or other adverse environmental events. For example, we work to minimize spills \\nthrough a combined program of effective operations integrity management, ongoing upgrades, key \\nequipment replacement s, and comprehensive inspection and surveillance. Similarly, we are \\nimplementing cost -effective new technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce \\nemissions, not only in response to government requirements but also to address community \\npriorit ies. We employ a robust and actively evolving enterprise risk management system to identify \\nand manage risk across our businesses. We also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls \\nand apply a controls management system for monitoring complianc e with this framework. \\nSubstantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if we do not timely identify and mitigate \\napplicable risks, or if our management systems and controls do not function as intended.  \\nCybersecurity . ExxonMobil is regularly subject to attempted cybersecurity disruptions from a variety \\nof sources including state -sponsored actors. See Item 1C in ExxonMobil’s 2023 Form 10 -K for \\ninformation on ExxonMobil’s program for managing cybersecurity risks.  If the measures we are \\ntaking to protect against cybersecurity disruptions prove to be insufficient or if our proprietary data \\nis otherwise not protected, ExxonMobil, as well as our customers, employees, or third parties, could \\nbe adversely affected. We have limited ability to influence third parties, including our partners, \\nsuppliers and service providers (including providers of cloud -hosting services for our data or \\napplications), to implement strong cybersecurity controls and are exposed to potential harm from \\ncybersecurit y events that may affect their operations. Cybersecurity disruptions could cause physical \\nharm to people or the environment; damage or destroy assets; compromise business systems; result \\nin proprietary information being altered, lost, or stolen; result in employee, customer, or third -party \\ninformation being compromised; or otherwise disrupt our business operations. We could incur \\nsignificant costs to remedy the effects of a major cybersecurity disruption in addition to costs in \\nconnection with resulting reg ulatory actions, litigation, or reputational harm.  \\nPreparedness . Our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events, natural disasters, human \\nerror, and similar events. For example, hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\financial_reports_2024_08_06\\\\Energy\\\\ExxonMobil\\\\2023_FAFRs_final.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='8 \\n coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas. Our facilities are designed, engineered, \\nconstructed, and operated to withstand a variety of extreme climatic and other conditions, with \\nsafety factors built in to cover a number of uncertainties, incl uding those associated with wave, wind, \\nand current intensity, marine ice flow patterns, permafrost stability, storm surge magnitude, \\ntemperature extremes, extreme rainfall events, and earthquakes. Our consideration of changing \\nweather conditions and inclu sion of safety factors in design covers the engineering uncertainties that \\nclimate change and other events may potentially introduce. Our ability to mitigate the adverse \\nimpacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility engineering, our \\nrigorous disaster preparedness and response, and business continuity planning.  \\nInsurance limitations . The ability of the Corporation to insure against many of the risks it faces as \\ndescribed in this document is limited by the avail ability and cost of coverage, which may not be \\neconomic, as well as the capacity of the applicable insurance markets, which may not be sufficient.  \\nCompetition . As noted in Item 1 of ExxonMobil’s 2023 Form 10 -K, the energy and petrochemical \\nindustries are highly competitive. We face competition not only from other private firms, but also \\nfrom state -owned companies that are increasingly competing for opportunities outside of their \\nhome countries and as partners with other private firms. In some cases, th ese state -owned \\ncompanies may pursue opportunities in furtherance of strategic objectives of their government \\nowners, with less focus on financial returns than companies owned by private shareholders, such as \\nExxonMobil. Technology and expertise provided b y industry service companies may also enhance the \\ncompetitiveness of firms that may not have the internal resources and capabilities of ExxonMobil or \\nreduce the need for resource -owning countries to partner with private -sector oil and gas companies \\nin orde r to monetize national resources. As described in more detail above, our hydrocarbon -based \\nenergy products are also subject to growing and, in many cases, government -supported competition \\nfrom alternative energy sources.  \\nReputation . Our reputation is an im portant corporate asset. Factors that could have a negative \\nimpact on our reputation include an operating incident or significant cybersecurity disruption; \\nchanges in consumer views concerning our products; a perception by investors or others that the \\nCorp oration is making insufficient progress with respect to our ambition to play a leading role in the \\nenergy transition, or that pursuit of this ambition may result in allocation of capital to investments \\nwith reduced returns; and other adverse events such as  those described in this document . Negative \\nimpacts on our reputation could in turn make it more difficult for us to compete successfully for new \\nopportunities, obtain necessary regulatory approvals, obtain financing, and attract talent, or they \\ncould reduce consumer demand for our branded products. ExxonMobil’s reputation may also be \\nharmed by events which negatively affect the image of our industry as a whole.  \\n '),\n",

Our Capex includes our share of similar costs \\nfor equity companies. Capex excludes assets acquired in nonmonetary exchanges, the value of ExxonMobil shares used to acquire assets, and \\ndepreciation on the cost of exploration support equipment and facilities recorded to property, plant and equipment when acquired. While we are \\nresponsible for all investments and elements of net income, we place particular focus on managing the controllable aspects of this group of \\nexpenditures.\\nCapital employed (Non-GAAP) •  Measure of net investment. When viewed from the perspective of how the capital is used by the businesses, it \\nincludes ExxonMobil’s net share of property, plant and equipment, and other assets, less liabilities, excluding both short-term and long-term debt. \\nWhen viewed from the perspective of the sources of capital employed in total for the Corporation, it includes our share of total debt and equity. Both of \\nthese views include our share of amounts applicable to equity companies, which we believe should be included to provide a more comprehensive \\nmeasure of capital employed. Capital employed is a component of Return on average capital employed (defined below), which we view  as one of the \\nbest measures of historical capital productivity in our capital-intensive, long-term industry.\\nReconciliation of total assets to capital employed (Non-GAAP) 2023 2022 2021\\n(millions of dollars)\\nBusiness uses: asset and liability perspective\\nTotal assets 376,317 369,067 338,923\\nLess liabilities and noncontrolling interests share of assets and liabilities\\nTotal current liabilities excluding notes and loans payable (61,226) (68,411) (52,367)\\nTotal long-term liabilities excluding long-term debt (60,980) (56,990) (63,169)\\nNoncontrolling interests share of assets and liabilities (8,878) (9,205) (8,746)\\nAdd ExxonMobil share of debt-financed equity company net assets 3,481 3,705 4,001\\nTotal capital employed (Non-GAAP) 248,714 238,166 218,642\\nTotal corporate sources: debt and equity perspective\\nNotes and loans payable 4,090 634 4,276\\nLong-term debt 37,483 40,559 43,428\\nExxonMobil share of equity 204,802 195,049 168,577\\nLess noncontrolling interests share of total debt (1,142) (1,781) (1,640)\\nAdd ExxonMobil share of equity company debt 3,481 3,705 4,001\\nTotal capital employed (Non-GAAP) 248,714 238,166 218,642\\n1'),\n",

As a \\nreminder , at Brent between $60 and $80 a barrel real, and 10 -year average refinery and chemical \\nmargins , we expect to generate between $80 and $140 billion in cumulative surplus cash from 2024 \\nto 2027. The Pioneer acquisition increases that even further.  \\n In the quarter, we once again set production records from our advantaged assets in Guyana and the \\nPermian. Including Pioneer, our Permian production surged to 1.2 million barrels per day.  \\n In Product Solutions, our sales of high -return performance products rose 5% sequentially – to a new \\nrecord.  \\n Our strong performance in the quarter continues to support our capital allocation priorities, including \\nthe distribution of $9.5 billion to shareholders, of which $4.3 billion was in dividends.  \\n With the close of the Pioneer transaction, our shareholders now include the former owners of Pioneer \\nstock, who have begun to benefit from the strength of our combined companies. We welcome them \\nto ExxonMobil , just as we do the talented people of Pioneer, who bring a strong entrepreneurial \\nmindset and deep expertise in unconventional resource development.  \\n I also want to recognize the combined transaction team for their excellence in execution. The average \\ntime to complete this type of merger over the last several years has been more than 11 months. We \\nclosed Pioneer in six , once again demonstrating the strength of our organization in effectively \\nexecuting large, complicated projects – including large acquisitions.  \\n It is challenging work requiring deep thinking, a highly structured approach, and disciplined action – \\nareas where we excel. Although it’s still early days, the integration is exceeding our expectations, and \\nI’m confident we’ll deliver even more synergies than we’ve announced. The team looks forward to '),\n",

Later this month, we’ll publish our Global Outlook, which projects global energy \\ndemand 15% higher in 2050 than it is today. We see oi l demand holding steady at around 100 million \\nbarrels per day in 2050, while demand for renewables and natural gas grows considerably.  \\n An energy -abundant future, driven by economic growth and rising levels of prosperity, creates \\nopportunity for ExxonMobil – no matter the speed or direction of the energy transition. Over time, as \\nit becomes more and more obvious that heavy industry and com mercial transportation will not be \\nmeaningfully powered by renewables, the world will come to rely more on technologies where we \\nhave an advantage – including hydrogen, biofuels, and carbon capture and storage.  \\n A serious approach to the transition should focus on moving the world from high -carbon to low -\\ncarbon energy, not simply from oil and gas to wind and solar. The data, science, and economics all \\nsupport this as fundamentally necessary.  \\n Our strategy reflects this reality , and, since it relies on the same corporate capabilities and advantages \\nunder any scenario, it is extremely flexible , delivering strong profitability irrespective of the path society \\ntakes.  \\n  As a technology company that transforms molecules to meet society’s needs, we’re not defined by our \\nexisting product suite. We began as a maker of kerosene for lamps. Today, no one thinks of \\nExxonMobil as a “kerosene company” serving the lamp industry. In the future, ExxonMobil will be \\ndefined by the technologies and products it is producing to meet the world’s future needs – as always, \\nby drawing on our unique combination of competitive advantages.

Two examples where I see \\nsignificant new market potential are ProxximaTM and carbon materials.  \\n With ProxximaTM, we transform lower -value gasoline molecules into a high -performance, high -value \\nthermoset resin that can be used in coatings, light -weight construction materials, and advanced \\ncomposites for cars and trucks – including battery boxes for electric vehicles . Materials made with \\nProxximaTM are lighter, stronger, more durable, and produced with significantly fewer GHG emissions \\nthan traditional alternatives. In March, we showcased the automotive uses of ProxximaTM at the world’s \\nleading interna tional composites exhibition in Paris.  \\n We’re progressing projects in Texas, with startups planned in 2025, that will significantly expand our \\nproduction of ProxximaTM. We see the total addressable market for ProxximaTM at 5 million tons and \\n$30 billion  by 2030 , with demand growing faster than GDP , and returns above 15%. That’s an exciting \\nnew business opportunity , with significant profit potential , where we have unique and hard -to-\\nreplicate advantages – consistent with our strategy and core capabilities.  \\n We also see a sizable opportunity in carbon materials, transforming the molecular structure of low -\\nvalue, carbon -rich feeds from our refining processes into high -value products for a range of \\napplications. We’re targeting market segments with margins of se veral thousand dollars per ton and \\ngrowth rates outpacing GDP. These include carbon fiber, polymer additives, and battery materials.  \\n Our competitive advantages of scale, technology, and integration – combined with our North \\nAmerican manufacturing footprint – provides a foundation for building these compelling, new, high -\\nmargin businesses. I’ve challenged the Product Solutions team to le an into those opportunities and \\ndevelop plans to accelerate the growth of both of these profitable new businesses.  '),\n",

Consider VistamaxxTM, which we launched to enhance the \\nperformance of everything from auto parts and construction materials to personal care products and \\npackaging. We’ve grown our VistamaxxTM performance polymer from five grades to twenty  and total \\nannual production capacity to 700,000 metric tons per annum – with highly attractive returns and \\nsignificantly more growth potential.   \\n Of course, consistent with the track record we’ve established over the last 7 years, the hurdle for \\ninvesting will be high. Any investment will have to generate competitive returns , possess clear \\ncompetitive advantages , and be resilient to the bottom of any commodity cycle. As we’ve \\ndemonstrated, our capital -allocation decisions have generated robust earnings, cash flow, and \\nshareholder returns. I look forward to sharing more about our growth opportunities in December.  \\n In closing, we have a lot to feel good about. Our performance is strong. Our merger with Pioneer is \\nalready creating tremendous value, with more to come.

The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. If you would like \\nto ask a question, please do so by pressing the star key, followed by the digit 1 on your telephone. The \\nfirst question comes from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs.  Your line is open.  Please go ahead.  \\nNeil Mehta : Good morning, Darren and team, and thanks for the update.  I want to build on your comments \\non Pioneer, now that it's under your umbrella.  Can you build on some of your comments around , one, \\nhow is the asset performing from a volume and type curve perspective rel ative to expectations  and, \\ntwo,  you alluded to synergies tracking ahead of expectations.  Can you help delineate what those \\nbuckets of outperformance are?  \\nDarren Woods:   Yeah, good morning, Neil.  I'll start with a few comments and then let Kathy kind of \\nadd on top of t hat. I would say early days yet, t wo months in, but the work of the team prior to the \\nchange in control and what we've seen since then is extremely encouraging.  \\nAs we've stated,  the Pioneer assets basically delivered a record performance in the second quarter  and \\nif you think about the context of doing that with all the change s that w ere going on with respect to \\nthe merger, I think a real testament to the quality of the people there and the work that they've been \\ndoing.  \\nSo I'd say vectors are all pointing up.  I think probably better than what we had anticipated, but I would \\nalso say it's early in the process.  The teams today are working very well together,  which has led to \\nfrankly identifying a lot more value opportunitie s than frankly I think either of us could see when we \\nwere on opposite sides of the fence . And now that we're together working, we see essentially a lot of \\nopportunities  to transfer the best practices of ExxonMobil into Pioneer and likewise, to transfer a \\nnumber of best practices from Pioneer into the ExxonMobil base, which when you think about our \\nsize, has some tremendous leverage associated with it.  \"),\n",

As you know, when we commit to some of our \\nobjectives, they're based on some very detailed plans that sit behind them.  The organization today is \\nworking those plans, but  we already see significant upside potential.  Not only in the magnitude but in \\nthe pace of which we'll be able to deliver them, so  I think a really positive s tory there.  \\nI'll let Kathy maybe add some additional details.  Kathy?  \\nKathy Mikells:   Sure.  I think one of the things  we've been really pleased  by is the number of learnings \\nthat we've already had from Pioneer and so not only will we bring our technology and key development \\nto them but they're bringing a bunch of learning to us.  So we're al ready utilizing their remote logistics \\noperation center in our own drilling and completions operations in order to improve supply \\nchain.  They've done some things on the procurement side I'd say that we think can help us to kind of \\nleverage up our expertise.  \\nThey've been really good over the years  of locking up their acreage, so we think that's another thing \\nthat ultimately we can benefit from and then as I think everyone knows, they've got a quite large water \\ninfrastructure in the Midland Basin and we'll be l ooking to also leverage that.  \\nSo we've been really pleased with what they bring to the table and we're off to a really good start as \\nwe look at building a n integration  development plan with them that fully utilizes the technology that \\nwe bring to the table.  And so we're going to have a Corporate Plan Update in December , we're going \\nto do a Spotlight on the Upstream , and we'll update where we're at with the synergies and how we're \\nlooking forward at that time.  \\nDarren Woods:   Yeah, I'd just cap it off, Neil, with what we said at the time we announced the \\nacquisition that  we were going to produce more barrels at a lower cost in a more environmentally \\nfriendly way.  That continues to be the case.  That's obviously good for our company, but more \\nimportantly , as we said at the time, we'd continue to emphasize, it's good for the US.  It's good for the \"),\n",

It's good for the people living in the U .S.

Thank you, Darren.  Thanks, Kathy.  \\nOperator : The next question is from Betty Jiang with Barclays.  \\nBetty Jiang : Darren and Kathy, good morning.  Since we just talked about Permian, I'll hit on the other \\nregion  that's also hitting record production, so Guyana volumes continue to exceed expectations and \\nthe FPSOs just continue to produce well -above capacity.  Would love to just get an understanding of \\ndo you think this type of performance is likely to continue and is that tran slatable for what you will \\nexpect for the future projects that's yet to come?  \\nDarren Woods:   Sure, I'll take that, Betty.  Thank you, and good morning.  Good to hear from you \\nagain.  I would say what you're seeing is the collective effort of our organization focusing on what is a \\nvery high -value development and making sure that we are taking advantag e of all the opportunities \\nwe can find to safely grow production . And as you commented,  we're seeing some significant \\nimprovements with production rates  well above what we had based the investment decision on, and \\nthat's continuing across al l three of them.  \\nWe try to take that into account as we develop the next, and so in theory, you would think we build \\nthat into the base and don't continue to see that, but frankly, our experience is telling us otherwise, \\nwhich is this organization , complemented by the work that we're doing with our technology \\norganization, our Global Operations and Sustainability organization , every element of the organization \\nthat we have now created and functionalized is very focused on maximizing value.  \"),\n",

So \\nI would bet that we'll continue to see  outperformance  versus the basis on which we FID, but I would \\nalso tell you that every development is unique unto i tself and , obviously, we've got to get it up and \\nrunning and then let the teams get after it and find the opportunities to safely increase its capacity.  \\nBut I would just tell you , I would bet on our people to find that.

Good morning, Darren and Kathy.  \\nDarren Woods:  Good morning.  \\nKathy Mikells:  Good morning.  \\nDoug Leggate:  Still getting used to the new moniker, Darren, but thanks for having me on.  So, I wonder if I \\ncould ask a question about portfolio now that you've got Pioneer in the door.  You've got a lot of things \\nthat are perhaps , you could characterize as maybe noncore.  A lot of tails in the portfolio and I'm just \\ncurious, we haven't really heard much on the asset disposal front in a while and I'm curious if now that \\nyou've got two very significant concentrated assets to a certain  extent, the Permian and G uyana, what \\nit means for the portfolio in terms of high grading opportunities going forward.  \\nDarren Woods:  Yeah, I'll start with that, and then I'll let Kathy add anything that she wants to.  But I would say \\nactually, we've been f airly aggressively going after the tail . Remember I think back in 2019, we had \"),\n",

Of course we got into the \\npandemic and we said we're not going to – this is not a forced march.  We're going to basically divest \\nwhen the market conditions ensure that we can realize the va lue that we think the assets that we are \\nmarketing can be realized.  \\nAnd frankly, that's what we've been doing.  So as you look at where we're at to date, second quarter \\nthis year, I think we've basically gotten to the $15 billion in the Upstream and then if you look at what \\nwe've been doing in the Downstream, there's anothe r few billion dollars that we've added on top of \\nthat, so frankly, from a cleaning up the tail standpoint,  we've made significant progress.  \\nObviously, there's a few more things that we're working on, and we'll continue to assess every one of \\nthe assets in the portfolio to make sure that they are competitively advantaged.  And frankly, as we look \\nat new investments, we force those investments to  compete on an industry -wide  basis and make sure \\nthat they'r e advantaged versus the industry and therefore can supply product at low -cost -of-supply.  \\nWe also do that with all of our existing assets, and if they're not competitively positioned on an industry \\nsupply curve, then the organization has two options.  Either we come up with an advantaged \\ninvestment that makes them more competitive and moves them  to the left on the cost -of-supply curve , \\nor we look to divest, and that process has been ongoing across all of our businesses.  \\nAnd then obviously, the timing of when we then take action is a function of realizing the value that we \\nthink those divestments should bring and we're patient.  We're not going to rush that process.  And I \\nwould just say staying after it, being very steady, waiting for the market to be where it needs to be in \\norder for us to move ahead , has paid off significantly and basically we're delivering on what we said \\nwe were going to do and we'll continue to look at it.  \\nBut I wouldn't, I don't see any big step changes here in the medium term.  \"),\n",

In the \\nfirst half of the year, that was $1.6 billion.  \\nAnd then I would just note, we had a lot of activity in Upstream and so  that generated some positive \\nearnings for us in the quarter  and so if you look at my prepared remarks that we published earlier this \\nmorning, I talk about sort of $380 million in the U pstream being kind of these other one -off items and \\nthat was a lot of earnings coming in from divestments, only partially offset by the one -off costs \\nassociated with Pioneer.  \\nDoug Leggate:  Terrific.

So, Darren, you had a lot of good \\nupdates in your prepared remarks on some of the low carbon initiatives and there's been a lot of \\nprogress there it seems over the past few months and quarters, which is great to see.  I think back to \\nthe Corporate Plan you lai d out late last year, this is a growing wedge of your overall capital spending \\nin each of the next few years.  \\nSo I was wondering for some of the investment opportunities more about what you're focused on and \\nactually more capital to these areas so what's needed to make the final investment decision on both \\ncarbon materials or build the scale you talked about in li thium production?  Is it more commercialization \\nand off take?  Technology development, regulatory, something else.  \"),\n",

If I don't hit the mark, then please steer me in a slightly different direction.  \\nDevin McDermott : Sorry about that.  \\nDarren Woods :  I think your question around what's required to kind of continue to move along in our \\ninvestments in Low Carbon Solution s across the portfolio of products that we've been talking about, \\nand I would just say fundamentally, we expect in the low carbon businesses and in fact some of these \\nnew products that while they contribute to a lower carbon future, they also bring signific ant value in \\nuse in today's application.  \\nThey have to compete in the portfolio.  They have to be advantaged versus what's out there today, and \\nthey have to basically generate good returns across the commodity cycles.  And so the fundamental \\nphilosophy that we've been applying in the base business a lso is required in the new businesses that \\nwe're trying to generate.  So that's foundational , what each and Dan Ammann in particular, but then \\nthe stuff that's coming out of the Product Solutions organization has also got to meet that initial hurdle.  \\nAnd then as you look across each of them, the hurdles to clear to deliver on that expectation vary a \\nlittle bit.  I would say in Dan's business, with the carbon capture and storage, he and his team are \\nbuilding a brand new business, and so there are very fe w, I think, examples of where the company's \\nnot only developing the technology and the infrastructure and logistics system but also developing the \\ncapacity to supply while developing the demand and developing the market in general, and advocating \\non what I  would say are the initial policies needed to get things kickstarted.  So there are a lot of moving \\nparts.  \\nI would say the broader industry and business community, frankly , haven't gotten far enough along \\nthis to truly appreciate just how complicated it is, but I would say leveraging the capacity and capability \"),\n",

We're optimistic that the \\nregulations will reflect the intent of the legislat ion, and if it does, I think we'll have a very attractive \\nproject that we can then FID once those regulations are finalized.  \\nSo, I'm optimistic in that space and as you may have seen, we just added another 500,000 tons of \\ncarbon capture and storage into Dan's portfolio and there's a pipeline that the team continues to \\nwork.  So we see continued opportunity and growth with good retur ns in the carbon capture side of \\nthe equation.  \\nOn the lithium, same thing.  While lithium is an established market, it's fairly small with respect to what \\nits ultimate potential is and of course we're bringing on a new production method with some new \\ntechnology.  And so again, doing the work to understan d what the investments required there are and \\nto establish and ensure that  we've got a real advantage  versus what else is out there and what else \\nneeds to come on to meet the growing demand of lithium.  But again, I feel good about that.  \\nWe've told the team, we're not looking to rush this through and get something, get money \\nspent.  We're looking to make sure that we build a very strong long -term foundation.  So none of the  \\nwork that we're doing in these new businesses is schedule -driven.  It's all about establishing successful \\nlong -term foundations.  \\nAnd then maybe just briefly touch on Proxxima and the carbon ventures, which that's a broader effort \\nthat we've been on for quite some time which is to say leverage our technical capabilities to transform \\nmolecules and apply that to markets that exist with  unmet needs, and I think  we're making really good \"),\n",

And so I'm anxious to kind of prosecute that business and establish it as quickly as \\nwe can, because we see real potential there.  \\nAnd same with carbon ventures, again leveraging our ability to transform the molecule, shape the \\nmolecules and get some structures that improve performance.  I think there's a big \\nopportunity  there.  But that's, I would say carbon ventures is still early in the technology cycle , but I \\nthink we've gone far enough along to see some real opportunity there and as  I said in my prepared \\nremarks, the challenge  I've given the Product Solutions organization is what's a realistic but aggressive \\nbusiness plan look like and what would be the  investment required to establish that . And that's good \\nbecause it grows value today, but it also positions us well as those molecules become less demanded \\nin their traditional applications, it becomes a much lower feedstock to these new applications.  \\nAnd so there's  a lot of opportunity  to diversify this and protect the business or diversify the business \\nas we move through the transition.  So, long answer, but a lot of variables at play here , but frankly all \\nvariables that we feel very comfortable managing and I think the progress we're making there \\ndemonstrates our capability to manage those things.  \\nDevin McDermott : Great.

Good morning, thanks for taking my questi on. So my question's on the Cape x guidance \\nupdate.

I'll start with that and then let Kathy finish up, but so the way  –  the \\nreaso n we put a range out on the Cape x – is we build these plans the previous year, starting around \\nthis time in the summertime, and then kind of lock and load them in October . And obviously, there's a \\nlot of things that develop and evolve from the middle of the previous year as we go into this year.  \\nThat range is not meant to have you guys slice it down the middle and fix on a number.  The range is to \\nsay we've got optionality here and as things evolve, we may reduce some of the spending or if we find \\nthat the opportunities are panning out the way we e xpect, we may be on the other end so that range \\nis truly where we expect to be somewhere in, depending on how things evolve and what the \\nopportunity set looks like.  \\nThe key focus here is to make sure that we're investing in highly -advantaged, highly -profitable projects, \\nand basically, as we worked our way from October of last year into this year, we see  a lot of attractive \\nopportunities  that we continue to invest in w hich puts us at the top end of that , consistent with what \\nwe understood the opportunity set could look like as we went in to the plan process last year.  That's \\nwhy we're coming in at $25 billion, and of course we're using the Pioneer number to add on top o f \\nthat.  \\nBut Kathy, anything to add to that?  \\nKathy Mikells:  I would just say , obviously, we have a lot of projects coming online in 2025 and the exact pace \\nof all of those and therefore, making sure that we provided sort of enough room I would say in the \\ninitial guidance supporting all of those projects that are coming online in 20 25. We can't pinpoint \\npredict all of that as we put our plans together for the year, and so just as an example, China 1 is a \\nhuge project.  It's going to be coming online early next year as an example, so there's always a lit tle bit \\nof give and take, which is why we give the range to start with.  \\nJohn Royall:  Thank you.  \"),\n",

Thanks for taking my questions.  I actually wanted to follow -up \\non the 2025 project start -ups that you just mentioned and thanks for a little bit more detail on the \\nChina Chemicals complex, but as I look to the other projects coming onlin e, I think the largest earnings \\ncontributors include the Permian Crude pipeline and then in the Upstream, Golden Pass , and then the \\nnext Guyana boat, so I was just wondering if you could provide a little more color on those projects in \\nterm s of how they're progressing and kind of phasing through the year.  Thanks.  \\nDarren Woods:  So, I would say , consistent with the plans that we put out, the projects are all , with obviously \\nthe exception of Golden Pass , moving consistent with the plan development and the announced dates \\nthat we talked about.  All of them I think  we feel really good about in terms of the work  that we're doing \\nand the case for the contributions, the returns, the earnings that we expect to g et out of those projects , \\nI think we continue to feel good about.  \\nYou know, underpinning all the projects is we never try to take a position on where we're going to be \\nin the market cycle, but instead, make sure that these projects when they come on can compete in any \\nof the areas of the cycle, and we've actually found t hat if you look at the investments we've made since \\n2018, we brought online , if you look at the aggregate return of that portfolio, it's exceeding the basis \\noln which we FID ’d those projects.  Even as we've been , say, in the Chemical business, the bottom -of-\\nthe-cycle conditions.  \\nSo I think we continue to demonstrate to ourselves the time we spend to make sure these projects are \\nadvantaged in the base case is paying off, and then of course our Global P roject s organization is really \\ncontinuing to drive very effective execution of the portfolio with keeping our costs well within the FID \\nbasis and generally delivering it faster and therefore bringing more value sooner.  \"),\n",

You noted a couple projects.  I mean the Singapore Resid upgrade project is a pretty big \\nupgrade project.  We have an upgrade project at F awley  in order to bring on ultra -low-sulfur \\ndiesel.

Your line is open.  Please go ahead.  \\nBiraj Borkhataria:  Hi there.  Thanks for taking my question.  Just wanted to follow -up on Jason's \\nquestion and more specifically, on Golden Pass.  So I guess , at this point, are you able to confirm \\nupdated scheduled guidance for the start -up? \\nAnd then second question is just going to some of your prepared remarks.  If I think about your \\nUpstream portfolio, a lot of your growth  is liquids, all liquids price linked through LNG.  I think you say \\n80% of your Upstream is now linked to liquids, so I wa s thinking as you're building out your LNG \\nportfolio and your trading function, is there any desire to diversify that sales mix a bit more, or is this \\nintentional in where you want to be?  Thank you.  \\nDarren Woods:  Yeah, sure.  I'll start with the last part of the question, which is , it is a consci ous decision to get \\nweighted on liquid prices and frankly, if you look at the LNG market, and when you're building large \"),\n",

So my expectation is we'll continue to be weighted on that and we're very comfortable with that.  \\nIn fact , there's been a huge drive since I've been in this job and brought Neil into the Upstream to \\nbasically shift the portfolio and get a little heavier weighting in the oil side.  As I mentioned this morning \\non CNBC, if you look at the oil that we're producing today, we're producing more oil than any time \\nsince the merger of Exxon and Mobil, so  that strategy is beginning to manifest itself.  \\nOn your Golden Pass, the project , so we've just gotten through, the venture  just reached a settlement \\nwith Zachry and so that venture's in the process of kind of restaffing and getting started back up \\nagain.  Obviously, we're in the very early days of that, so there's still more work to be done and of course \\nthe teams are very foc used on getting back to work , effectively executing and bringing that project in \\nas quickly as they can , and as close to the original schedule as they can.  \\nRight now, our estimate is we're going to see about a six -month slippage . So we had anticipated kind \\nof first LNG the middle of next year.  We now are looking at probably the back end of 2025 for first \\nLNG and that's kind of where the current schedule is , but I would just condition that with the teams \\nare just getting back up and running and they have a clear mandate to try to bring that in as effectively \\nas they can and, again, my expectation is they'll do better than we currently think but we've got work  \\nto do.  \\nBiraj Borkhataria:  Understood.

So if you go back  in time, the functional organizations \\nthat we establish ed, we had a refining organization that was producing refining products and we had \\na fuels marketing organization that was marketing fuels and we had a chemical company that was \\nmarketin g Chemicals.  We've now combined all that into a Product Solutions organization, which is \\nsupported by a technology organization, which again is not organized around any of our heritage \\nbusinesses or heritage products but instead is organized around core ca pabilities, core technical \\ncapabilities to deliver value to the businesses that they support.  \\nSo while it may not be intuitively obvious, that change in structure and the way we think about and talk \\nabout the business has also opened up a lot of white space in terms of the challenge here , is how do \\nwe take our core advantages, core capabilities  – some of it includes our existing footprint but a lot of \\nit includes our ability to upsell and to identify value in use applications  – and combine that with a \\ntechnology organization that's very focused on applying core technology capabilities to business \\nchallenges and business opportunities, which is starting to unlock applications that frankly in the past \\nwouldn't have been identified because they didn't fit in the context of the organizations that we had in \\nplace.  \"),\n",

My expectation is as we go forward  we'll continue to talk about those \\nmarkets and we'll talk about the applications that we're developing, and the technology organizations \\ncontinuing to look at how else can we use our capabilities in manipulating the molecules and \\nparticularly hydrogen and  carbon molecules to make products that the society needs and at the same \\ntime reduce emissions.  \\nSo I think that organization has been given a license, a hunting license, to go out and find how we can \\nlean into and create more value out there and grow earnings . So my expectation is , as we go forward, \\nwell-beyond the 2027 timeframe, we're going to continue to bring in opportunity sets as we unlock \\nthem through the work of both our Product Solutions organization but also our Technology \\norganization.  \\nThen , of course , we can take advantage of our projects organization and then go off and build these \\nthings at -scale and do it at a lower cost than anybody  else.  So I think it's a really powerful combination \\nthere.  \\nAnd our horizon extends well -beyond the 2027 , in terms of thinking through the pipeline and making \\nsure that  we're positioned to be successful well into the future.  \\nAnd I would just quickly add then, and that's true for Product Solutions, which has got the chemical \\nportfolio, our specialty portfolio and then what I would say are the energy portfolio but more \\nspecifically the molecules that go into energy, that we expect to become feedstocks of the future, like \\nthey are today for our carbon ventures and Proxxi maTM ventures.  \\nOn the Upstream side, we've got a lot of obviously growth potential through the back end of this \\ndecade, but  this is a depletion business.

Good morning.  Since you all have probably the most geographically diverse \\nset of operations of anyone we cover, I was just curious,  the most recent news this morning shows \\nmaybe a few cracks in the economy.  If you could kind of give us an idea as you look across the products \\nand the chemical side, thinking that's where we really see the demand parts, what you're seeing, kind \\nof let's say China back around to our side of the globe.  \\nDarren Woods:  Sure, good morning, Roger.  I think the key message I would leave you with across our business \\nis, when you look at kind of pricing and margins , is there's two pieces, two halves to the \\nequation.  There's the demand side and there's the supply side.  \\nOn the demand side, frankly, let's start with Chemicals.  We see the demand basically returning to the \\nkind of growth that  we've seen prior to the pandemic, so basically growing at 1% to 2% above GDP  and \\nso that's back on track from a growth standpoint.  Certainly that's what we're seeing at the first half of \\nthis year.  \\nThe challenge in that business with the margins  has been frankly from the supply side of the equation \\nwith a lot of capacity coming on, and a queue of capacity you have to come on.  And so that's been \\nmore of the story in Chemicals.  Less of a demand growth story and more of a supply story and a lot of \\nsupply coming on in the short -term.  And like the past, the  challenge in the Chemical business given \"),\n",

And as you come around to the U .S., we're \\nseeing kind of reasonable economic conditions and growth in the U .S. as well.  Europe  I think is \\nprobably the most challenged area of the globe and frankly, with some of the policies we see Europe \\nimplementing, my expectation is  it's going to be more challenging , quite frankly , and unfortunately \\nparticularly unfortunate  for the folks living in Europe given the drag that the policy they're putting in \\nplace is going to put on their economy.  But, I think China's looking reasonable.  \\nIndia is growing and looks very, very healthy.  The U .S. is looking reasonable with good \\ngrowth.  Demand for , on the energy side of the equation with petroleum products , continues to be very \\nhigh – record levels of demand around the world  and, again , I think very good supply coming in to the \\nequation there, which is keeping, has brought margins from those very high levels that we've seen in \\nthe first quarter and back into last year.  We're now getting back down into more typical ranges, and \\nfrankly all  of our plans anticipated that.  It's always difficult to call  the timing of it, but we certainly knew \\nthat the elevated margins that we were seeing in the refining business would ultimately come back \\ninto normal ranges.  \"),\n",

We'll see times when the margins spike and we'll see times when  the margins are \\nchallenging  but again we've built our refining business to be robust to those and if you look at the work \\nwe've been doing to high grade that portfolio, we've taken out a lot of the low margin, less advantaged \\nrefineries and are now focused on the integrated refineries that have a mix of high -value products that  \\nwe're producing and are advantage d from a size and scale and cost standpoint.  \\nAnd then on the gas side of the equation and the oil side of the equation,  oil demand continues to be \\nat record levels.  Last year was a record.  We anticipate this year will be a record, and then next year will \\nbe a record, so  demand continues to be fairly healthy from an oil standpoint.  It's just a question of \\nworking through the supply that's coming on , most of that led by what's happening in the Americas.  \\nAnd then on gas, that's going to continue to grow in demand and it's, again, a function of the capacity \\nthat's coming on.

Good morning, Darren and Kathy.  You continue to make good progress on \\nthe cost savings front.  It looks like there was an uptick  of about $600 million sequentially.  It looks \\nlike you called out around a $200 million turnaround savings in Energy Prod ucts.  Just wanted to see if \\nyou could provide some more examples of what's driving the improvement and how you take the \\ncurrent kind of $10.7 billion to the $15 billion over the next few years.

And so you're right.  If we look on an after -tax basis, we \\nhad about $600 million overall on a pre -tax basis for the year -to-date where  our structural cost savings \\nallowed $1 billion, so making really good progress.  \\nContinuing to optimize maintenance is a big driver of overall savings.  We gave a number of $200 \\nmillion in Energy Products in terms of my prepared remarks and that was just noting that in the half, \\nwe had a particularly heavy turnaround slate and if we loo ked back at that same turnaround slate, the \\nlast time we did it, we did it much more quickly and we did it at lower cost, hence the $200 million \\nsavings number that you mentioned.  \\nYou know, we're also obviously driving savings in terms of supply chain and looking to get more \\nefficient there and all of our centralized organizations, which we've kind of stood up over the last \\ncouple of years, are really responsible for driving savings  into the business, so whether that's global \\nbusiness solutions, or whether that's supply chain, or our global operating and sustainability group \\nwho works on our maintenance activities,  we're really starting to see the uptick from the benefit  that \\nthose o rganizations can bring by simplifying things and standardizing things and bringing better data \\nanalytics that optimize our overall organization.  \\nSo that's what you're going to continue to see on a go -forward basis and then I would say longer term , \\nas those centralized organizations start to standardize processes for the company, which are quite \\ndisparate as we sit here today, we'll be able to apply more technology to get, I would say, even more \\nautomated in the things that we do,  which will drive f urther efficiencies for us  long -term.  \\nSo whether it's getting more efficient on logistics or getting more efficient because we're standardizing \\nnow between ourselves and Pioneer, standardizing all the materials and things that we're buying, \\nthose are the types of things that'll continue to dri ve savings.

Our final question will be from Bob Brackett with \\nBernstein Research.  \\nBob Brackett:  Good morning.  I'd like to paraphrase a comment Darren made that lithium complexity is \\nmisunderstood by the industry, and I'm intrigued.  Is that a comment around the marketing and the \\nrelative use of the Downstream side, or is it a comment around maybe the Upstream and the \\ncomplexity of processing?  \"),\n",

Yeah, that comment, I meant to imply f ar more broadly the whole Low \\nCarbon S olutions business set whereas you look at each of those businesses , they've got their unique \\nset of complexities.  For lithium in particular you're taking what is essentially a brand new technology , \\nmarrying that with some established technologies for sub -surface , some established technologies \\nabove surface consistent with our processing experiences and refining and chemicals . And so putting \\nthose thi ngs together in a new business to make a product, I wouldn't say has complexities that people \\ncan't comprehend.  I would just say they're new and there haven't been very many people that worked \\nour way through that.  \\nWhere  some really unique  challenges  are is in the building brand new value chains and the carbon \\ncapture market , as an example , where there's just not an existing market today that pays for carbon \\nremoval . That's being incentivized with government policy, government policy is forming while at the \\nsame time you're trying to build the infrastructure to support that market, the logistics, the supply, and \\nthen at the same time, develop a customer base.  \\nAnd so the complexity that I see in the low carbon space,  that's a particularly challenging  one because \\nof all the moving parts and all the work that has to be done to try to piece those things together to \\ncome up with frankly a business and business model  that one , is sustainable for the long -term and two, \\nthat generates returns that are competitive in the portfolio.  \\nBut I have to say, we're geared to do that kind of work.  Our experience lends itself to that and frankly \\nwhat Dan and the team is accomplishing , leaning on a lot of the core capabilities of the organization, \\nwe're tackling those challenges and making really good progress.  \\nI think on the hydrogen side of the equation, there's not a real vibrant market, or a strongly economic \\nmarket for low virtually carbon -free hydrogen, so that's being developed.  Obviously, the government \\nincentives are supporting that in the short -term but  we've got to work our way to market -driven forces \"),\n",

So that's  I think \\none of the challenges in that space.  \\nBut I think  my comment was more generally , that there's a lot of optimism around the low carbon \\nbusinesses in general, but if you think about where progress has been made to date, most of that's \\nbeen in the wind and solar and EV areas and all those are playing into well -established markets.  The \\npower generation market is very well -established.  The automotive industry is very well -\\nestablished.

We are \\nvery happy to have you on board.   \\n \\nAs you know,  Pioneer transforms our Upstream portfolio , more than doubling our Permian \\nfootprint. We are now  the largest  producer in both the Permian basin and the entire United \\nStates  with  a business that has  the largest high -return U.S. unconventional inventory . \\n \\nThe bottom line is that t his acquisition has enabled us to further distance our selves from the \\nrest of the industry both strategically and financially.  \\n \\nThe value creation runway that we are creating at ExxonMobil extends long into the future. The \\nopportunities we see are fueled by what has been a core competitive advantage since our \\nfounding: technology. This is the bedrock of the Pioneer synergies and the new businesses we \\nare buildin g. \\n \\nOur expertise in managing molecules  enables  new high value products like ProxximaTM – a \\nunique ly strong, lightweight and corr osion resistant resin made from low -value gasoline  \\ncomponents. In March , we rolled out the automotive value -generative uses of ProxximaTM at \\nthe world’s leading international composites exhibition in Paris . This adds to the rebar  products \\nalready being marketed. We see the total addressable market potential  for ProxximaTM at 5 \\nmillion tons and 30 billion dollars by 2030 , with demand growing faster than GDP  and returns \\nabove 15%. Based on this, we’re progressing projects in Texas, with startups planned in 2025, \\nthat will significantly expand our prod uction of ProxximaTM. \\n \\nSimilarly, in our carbon materials venture, we see a sizable opportunity to transform the \\nmolecular structures of low -value, carbon -rich streams  from our refining processes into high -\\nvalue products for a range of applications.

Both  are key to driving earnings power growth.  We’re on pace for $1. 7 billion  in \\nearnings from strategic projects in 2024. This reflects c ontributions from our Advanced \\nHydrocracker in Rotterdam, the Beaumont expansion, the Permian Crude venture, as well as \\nchemical projects in Corpus Christi, Baton Rouge, and Baytown.  We expect to see even more \\nearnings contributions through 2027 with our China Chemical Complex, Singapore Resid \\nUpgrade project, and Strathcona renewable diesel project s all remain ing on track to start up in \\n2025.    \\n \\nWe’re also grow ing earnings by improving our product mix – upgrading lower -value  molecules \\ninto high er-value products , such as performance chemicals and performance lubricants , and \\nleveraging our global manufacturing footprint to produce low -emission fuels through co -\\nprocessing and repurposing units . By 2027, we expect  to double high -value product sa les to \\nmore than 20 million tons per year. We’ve grown  year -to date  sales of high -value products by \\n10%  vs. this time last year , to nearly 7 million tons .  \\n \\nWe’re also focused on permanently taking cost out of our businesses. Maintenance \\ntransformation activities, such as centralized assessments of optimal routine equipment \\nmaintenance , employing a consistent global turnaround planning framework, and more widely \\napplying best practices are all examples of activities that reduce  cost,  while enabling higher \\nutilization at our sites.  \\n \\nWith $10.7 billion of structural cost savings achieved to -date versus 2019, we have a proven \\ntrack record of capturing efficiencies.

The prior-year \\nperiod was negatively impacted by tax-related identified items. Excluding identified items, earnings increased \\n$1.5 billion due to advantaged assets volume growth from record Guyana, heritage Permian and Pioneer \\nproduction. Year-to-date net production was 4.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, an increase of 9%, or \\n352,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day. Higher crude realizations and structural cost savings offset lower natural \\ngas realizations, higher expenses mainly from depreciation, and lower base volumes due to divestments of non-\\nstrategic assets and government-mandated curtailments.  \\n•Second-quarter earnings were $7.1 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion from the first quarter driven by the Pioneer \\nacquisition, record Guyana and heritage Permian production, and structural cost savings. Higher crude \\nrealizations and divestment gains more than offset lower gas realizations. Net production in the second quarter \\nwas 4.4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, an increase of 15%, or 574,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day \\ncompared to the prior quarter due to advantaged volume growth from Pioneer, Guyana and heritage Permian.  \\n•On May 3, 2024, ExxonMobil completed the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources. The company issued 545 \\nmillion shares of ExxonMobil common stock having a fair value of $63 billion on the acquisition date and \\nassumed $5 billion of debt. The merger of ExxonMobil and Pioneer created the largest, high-return \\nunconventional resource development potential in the world.\\n•In the quarter, the Company submitted an application to the Guyanese Environmental Protection Agency for the \\nHammerhead project, the proposed seventh development.

Because of the regular nature of our asset \\nmanagement and divestment program, the company believes it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with the \\nsales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments together with cash provided by \\noperating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities. A reconciliation to net \\ncash provided by operating activities for the 2023 and 2024 periods is shown on page 7.\\nThis press release also includes cash flow from operations excluding working capital (non-GAAP), and cash flow from \\noperations and asset sales excluding working capital (non-GAAP). The company believes it is useful for investors to consider \\nthese numbers in comparing the underlying performance of the company's business across periods when there are significant \\nperiod-to-period differences in the amount of changes in working capital. A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating \\nactivities for the 2023 and 2024 periods is shown on page 7. \\nThis press release also includes Earnings/(Loss) Excluding Identified Items (non-GAAP), which are earnings/(loss) excluding \\nindividually significant non-operational events with, typically, an absolute corporate total earnings impact of at least $250 million \\nin a given quarter. The earnings/(loss) impact of an identified item for an individual segment may be less than $250 million when \\nthe item impacts several periods or several segments. Earnings/(loss) excluding Identified Items does include non-operational \\nearnings events or impacts that are generally below the $250 million threshold utilized for identified items. When the effect of \\nthese events is significant in aggregate, it is indicated in analysis of period results as part of quarterly earnings press release \\nand teleconference materials. Management uses these figures to improve comparability of the underlying business across \\nmultiple periods by isolating and removing significant non-operational events from business results. The Corporation believes \\nthis view provides investors increased transparency into business results and trends and provides investors with a view of the \\nbusiness as seen through the eyes of management. Earnings excluding Identified Items is not meant to be viewed in isolation or \\nas a substitute for net income/(loss) attributable to ExxonMobil as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation to \\neach of corporate earnings and segment earnings are shown for 2024 and 2023 periods in Attachments II-a and II-b. Earnings \\nper share amounts are shown on page 1 and in Attachment II-a, including a reconciliation to earnings/(loss) per common share \\n– assuming dilution (U.S. GAAP).\\nThis press release also includes total taxes including sales-based taxes. This is a broader indicator of the total tax burden on the \\nCorporation’s products and earnings, including certain sales and value-added taxes imposed on and concurrent with revenue-\\nproducing transactions with customers and collected on behalf of governmental authorities (“sales-based taxes”). It combines \\n“Income taxes” and “Total other taxes and duties” with sales-based taxes, which are reported net in the income statement. The \\ncompany believes it is useful for the Corporation and its investors to understand the total tax burden imposed on the \\nCorporation’s products and earnings. A reconciliation to total taxes is shown in Attachment I-a.\\nThis press release also references free cash flow (non-GAAP) and free cash flow excluding working capital (non-GAAP). Free \\ncash flow is the sum of net cash provided by operating activities and net cash flow used in investing activities excluding cash \\nacquired from mergers and acquisitions. These measures are useful when evaluating cash available for financing activities, \\nincluding shareholder distributions, after investment in the business.

The Outlook  is reflective  of the existing  global  policy  environment  and an assumption  of increasing  policy  stringency  and \\ntechnology  improvement  to 2050 . Current  trends  for policy  stringency  and deployment  of lower -emission  solutions  are not yet on a pathway  to achieve  net-zero  by 2050 .

Represents the combined total of additions at cost to property, plant and equipment, and exploration expenses on a before -tax basis \\nfrom the Consolidated Statement of Income. ExxonMobil’s Capex includes its share of similar costs for equity companies. Capex  excludes assets acquired in nonmonetary exchanges, the value of ExxonMobil \\nshares used to acquire assets, and depreciation on the cost of exploration support equipment and facilities recorded to property, plant and equipment when acquired. While ExxonMobil’s management is \\nresponsible for all investments and elements of net income, particular focus is placed on managing the controllable aspects o f this group of expenditures.\\nCash operating expenses excluding energy and production taxes (non -GAAP). Subset of total operating costs that are stewarded internally to support management’s oversight of spending over time. This \\nmeasure is useful for investors to understand our efforts to optimize cash through disciplined expense management for items w ithin management’s control .\\nCompound annual growth rate (CAGR) . Represents the consistent rate at which an investment or business result would have grown had the investment or business re sult compounded at the same rate \\neach year.\\nDebt to capital (debt -to-capital, debt -to-capital ratio, leverage). Total debt / (Total debt + Total equity). Total debt is the sum of (1) Notes and loans payable and (2) Long -term debt, as report ed in \\nExxonMobil’s Form 10 -Qs and 10 -Ks.\\nDistributions to shareholders (shareholder distributions) . The Corporation distributes cash to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share purchases. Shares are acquired to reduce shares \\noutstanding and to offset shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction with company benefit plans and programs. Fo r the purposes of calculating distributions to shareholders, the Corporation \\nincludes only the cost of those shares acquired to reduce shares outstanding.\\nDivestments . Refers to asset sales; results include associated cash proceeds and production impacts, as applicable, and are consistent w ith our internal planning.\\nEarnings (loss) excluding Identified Items (Earnings ex. Ident. Items) (non -GAAP) . Earnings (loss) excluding individually significant non -operational events with, typically, an absolute corporate total \\nearnings impact of at least $250 million in a given quarter. The earnings (loss) impact of an Identified Item for an individu al segment may be less than $250 million when the item impacts several periods or \\nseveral segments . Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items does include non -operational earnings events or impacts that are generally below th e $250 million threshold utilized for Identified Items. When the \\neffect of these events is significant in aggregate, it is indicated in analysis of period results as part of quarterly earnin gs press release and teleconference materials . Management uses these figures to improve \\ncomparability of the underlying business across multiple periods by isolating and removing significant non -operational events fr om business results. The Corporation believes this view provides investors \\nincreased transparency into business results and trends and provides investors with a view of the business as seen through th e eyes of management.

IOC competitor peer group includes BP, Chevron, Shell, and TotalEnergies.\\nLower -emission fuels. Fuels with lower life cycle emissions than conventional transportation fuels for gasoline, diesel, and jet transport.\\nNet debt to capital (net debt -to-capital) . Defined as “net debt / (net debt + Total equity)” where net debt is total debt net of Cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash. Total debt is the sum of (1) \\nNotes and loans payable and (2) Long -term debt, as reported in ExxonMobil’s Form 10 -Qs and 10 -Ks.\\nOperating costs (Opex) (non -GAAP). Operating costs are the costs during the period to produce, manufacture, and otherwise prepare the company’s products for sal e – including energy, staffing, and \\nmaintenance costs. They exclude the cost of raw materials, taxes, and interest expense and are on a before -tax basis. While Exxo nMobil’s management is responsible for all revenue and expense elements of \\nnet income, operating costs, as defined above, represent the expenses most directly under management’s control, and therefore  are useful for investors and ExxonMobil management in evaluating \\nmanagement’s performance. For information concerning the calculation and reconciliation of operating costs see the table on s lide 33.\\nPerformance products (performance chemicals, performance lubricants). Refers to products that provide differentiated performance for multiple applications through enhanced properties versus \\ncommodity alternatives and bring significant additional value to customers and end -users.\\nProject. The term “project” as used in this presentation can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports. \\nProjects or plans may not reflect investment decisions made by the company.

Structural cost savings describe decreases in cash opex excluding energy and production taxes as a \\nresult of operational efficiencies, workforce reductions, divestment -related reductions, and other cost -savings measures, that a re expected to be sustainable compared to 2019 levels. Relative to 2019, \\nestimated cumulative structural cost savings totaled $10.7 billion, which included an additional $1.0 billion in the first si x months of 2024. The total change between periods in expenses will reflect both \\nstructural cost savings and other changes in spend, including market factors, such as inflation and foreign exchange impacts,  as well as changes in activity levels and costs associated with new operations , \\nmergers and acquisitions, new business venture development, and early -stage projects . Estimates of cumulative annual structural savings may be revised depending on whether cost reductions realized in \\nprior periods are determined to be sustainable compared to 2019 levels. Structural cost savings are stewarded internally to s upport management’s oversight of spending over time. This measure is useful for \\ninvestors to understand our efforts to optimize spending through disciplined expense management. For information concerning t he calculation and reconciliation of operating costs see the table on slide 33.\\nStructural earnings improvements (structural improvements, growing earnings power, improved earnings power). Structural earnings improvements consist of efforts to improve earnings on a like -for-like \\nprice and margin basis and incorporate improvement efforts by the corporation such as growing advantaged assets, improving mi x, and reducing structural costs .\\nTotal shareholder return (TSR) . Measures the change in value of an investment in common stock over a specified period of time, assuming dividend reinvestme nt. We calculate shareholder return over a \\nparticular measurement period by: dividing (1) the sum of (a) the cumulative value of dividends received during the measureme nt period, assuming reinvestment, plus (b) the difference between the stock \\nprice at the end and at the beginning of the measurement period; by (2) the stock price at the beginning of the measurement p eriod.

       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\financial_reports_2024_08_06\\\\Energy\\\\ExxonMobil\\\\frequently-used-terms.pdf', 'page': 0}, page_content='Listed below are definitions of several of ExxonMobil’s key business and financial performance measures and other terms. These definitions are provided to facilitate \\nunderstanding of the terms and their calculation. In the case of financial measures that we believe constitute “non-GAAP financial measures” under Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, we provide a reconciliation to the most comparable Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) measure and other information required by that rule.\\nTotal shareholder return (TSR) • Measures the change in value of an investment in stock over a specified period of time, assuming dividend reinvestment. We calculate \\nshareholder return over a particular measurement period by: dividing (1) the sum of (a) the cumulative value of dividends received during the measurement period, assuming \\nreinvestment, plus (b) the difference between the stock price at the end and  at the beginning of the measurement period; by (2) the stock price at the beginning of the \\nmeasurement period. For this purpose, we assume dividends are reinvested in stock at market prices at approximately the  same time actual dividends are paid. Shareholder  \\nreturn is usually quoted on an annualized basis.\\nCapital and exploration expenditures (Capex) •  Represents the combined total of additions at cost to property, plant and equipment, and exploration expenses on a before-tax \\nbasis from the Consolidated statement of income. ExxonMobil’s Capex includes its share of similar costs for equity companies. Capex excludes assets acquired in nonmonetary \\nexchanges, the value of ExxonMobil shares used to acquire assets, and depreciation on the cost of exploration support equipment and facilities recorded to property, plant and equipment when acquired. While ExxonMobil’s management is responsible for all investments and elements of net income, particular focus is placed on managing the controllable aspects of this group of expenditures.\\nReturns, rate of return, IRR •  Unless referring specifically to ROCE or external data, references to returns, rate of return, IRR, and similar terms mean future discounted cash flow \\nreturns on future capital investments based on current company estimates. Investment returns exclude prior exploration and acquisition costs.Heavy oil and oil sands •  Heavy oil  includes heavy oil, extra heavy oil, and bitumen, as defined by the World Petroleum Congress in 1987 based on American Petroleum \\nInstitute (API) gravity and viscosity at reservoir conditions. Heavy oil has an API gravity between 10 and 22.3 degrees. The API gravity of extra heavy oil and bitumen is  \\nless than 10 degrees. Extra heavy oil has a viscosity less than 10,000 centipoise, whereas the viscosity of bitumen is greater than 10,000 centipoise. The term “oil sands” \\nis used to indicate heavy oil (generally bitumen) that is recovered in a mining operation.Divestments •  Divestments represent the unadjusted sale price specified in the applicable contract of sale as of the effective date for asset divestiture agreements which the \\ncorporation or one of its affiliates has executed since January 1, 2019. Actual final sale price and cash proceeds may differ in amount and timing from the divestment value \\ndepending on applicable contract terms.\\nDebt to capital •  Debt to capital is defined as “total debt / (total debt + total equity). ”\\nPerformance product (performance chemicals) •  Refers to Chemical products that provide differentiated performance for multiple applications through enhanced properties \\nversus commodity alternatives and bring significant additional value to customers and end users .\\nProject • The term “project” can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.\\nProved reserves •  Proved reserve figures are determined in accordance with SEC definitions.\\nResources, resource base, and recoverable resources •  Along with similar terms, refer to the total remaining estimated quantities of oil and natural gas that are expected to be \\nultimately recoverable. The  resource base includes quantities of oil and natural gas classified as proved reserves, as well as quantities that are not yet classified as proved reserves, \\nbut that are expected to be ultimately recoverable. The term “resource base” or similar terms are not intended to correspond to SEC definitions such as “probable” or “possible” \\nreserves. The term “in-place” refers to those quantities of oil and natural gas estimated to be contained in  known accumulations and includes recoverable and unrecoverable \\namounts.FREQUENTLY USED TERMS\\n1'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\financial_reports_2024_08_06\\\\Energy\\\\ExxonMobil\\\\frequently-used-terms.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='Volume effects •  Entitlements – ne t interest a re changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes caused by non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. These  \\nf\\nactors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes achieve \\nd\\nefined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of \\nt\\nhe termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.\\nVolume effects •  Entitlements – pri ce, s pend an d other a re changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-\\nd\\netermining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or \\ng\\novernment royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, \\nf\\newer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural \\ngas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.\\nVolume effects • Government Mandates are changes to ExxonMobil’s sustainable production levels as a result of temporary non-operational production limits or sanctions \\nimposed by governments, gene rally upon a country, sector, type, or method of production.\\nVolume effects • Divestments a r e reductions in ExxonMobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to  fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange  \\nf\\nor financial o r other e conomic c onsideration.\\nVolume effects • Demand, g r owth , and other f actors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes \\nat\\ntributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work program activities, acquisitions including additions from \\na\\nsset exchanges, downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.Frequently U sed T erms, co ntinued\\nStructural cost savings • Structural cost savings describe decreases in the belo w expenses as a result of operational efficiencies, workforce reductions and other cost saving  \\nmeasures that are expected to be sustainable compared to 2019 levels. Relative to 2019, estimated cumulative annual structural cost  savings totaled $4.9 billion, of which  \\n$1.9 billion was achieved in  2021. The total change be tween  periods in expenses  below will reflect both structural cost savings and  other changes in spend , inclu ding ma rket \\nfactors, such as energy cos ts, inflation, and foreign e xcha nge impacts, as we ll as changes in activity levels and costs associated with new operations. Est imates of cumulative annual \\nstructural savings may be r evised as cost reductions realize d in prior periods a re determined to be sustainable  compared to 2019 level. Structural cost savings are stewarded \\ninternally to support manag ement’ s oversight of spending over time. This meas ure is useful for investors to understand the Corporat ion’s efforts to optimize  spend ing through \\ndisciplined expense management.\\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME LINE ITEMS TARGETED FOR STRUCTURAL COST SAVINGS 2021 2020 2019\\n(millions of dollars)\\nProduction and manufacturing expenses 36,035 30,431 36,826\\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 9,574 10,168 11,398\\nExploration expenses, including dry holes 1,054 1,285 1,269\\nTotal 46,663 41,884 49,493\\n2'),\n",

Assets are divested when they are no \\nlonger meeting these objectives or are worth considerably more to others.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  \\nNature of Operations\\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in \\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. \\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that \\nprovide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration \\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received \\nfor subscription-based products.\\nBasis of Consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated \\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  \\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally \\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal \\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of \\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2023 . We have made estimates and assumptions \\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual \\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in \\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form \\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022  filed with the SEC.\\nChange in Accounting Estimate\\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and \\nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years  to six years  and the estimated useful life of certain \\nnetwork equipment from five years  to six years . This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal \\nyear 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 202 2, and \\nthose placed in service during the quarter ended March 31, 2023 , the effect of this change in estimate was a \\nreduction in depreciation expense of $988 million  and an increase in net income of $770 million , or $0.06  per basic \\nand $0.06  per diluted share , for the three months ended March 31, 2023 . \\nStock Split Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend (“Stock Split”)\\nOn July 15, 2022, we executed a 20-for-one stock split of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. All prior \\nperiod references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and \\napplicable disclosures prior to the effective date have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock \\nSplit.\\nPrior Period Reclassifications\\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n10'),\n",

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services \\nthat have not yet been recognized as revenue. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these \\ncommitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our \\ncustomers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize \\nsuch as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 \\nmonths  with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue \\ncurrently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original \\nexpected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\\nDeferred Revenues\\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, \\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other.  \\nTotal deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022  was $4.5 billion , of which $1.6 billion  was recognized as revenues \\nduring the three months ended March 31, 2023 .Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n11'),\n",

We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, \\nearnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate \\nfluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance \\ninvestment returns.\\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the \\nderivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy \\ncomprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at \\ngross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\\nCash Flow Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge \\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have \\nmaturities of 24 months  or les s.\\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and \\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points \\nand time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life \\nof the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and \\nthe amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\\nAs of March 31, 2023  the net accumulated loss on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect \\nwas $55 million , which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\\nFair Value Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our \\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in \\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting \\ngains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge \\neffectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net.\\nNet Investment Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks \\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of \\nhedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude \\nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in \\nother income (expense), net.\\nOther Derivatives\\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to \\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the \\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting \\nhedges are primarily recorded in other income (expense), net along with the foreign currency gains and losses on \\nmonetary assets and liabilities.\\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, \\ncommodity prices, credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into derivatives \\nto hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising from other \\nderivatives are primarily reflected within the “other” component of other income (expense), net.

Net loss attributable to \\nnoncontrolling interests was not material for an y period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of \\nOI&E. See Note 6  for further details on OI&E.\\nUnconsolidated VIEs\\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private \\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve \\npower generation using renewable sources. \\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that \\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results \\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We \\naccount for these investments as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\\n The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the \\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. We have determined that the single source of our exposure to \\nthese VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated \\nVIEs were $2.7 billion  and $2.8 billion , respectively, as of December 31, 2022  and $2.6 billion  and $2.7 billion , \\nrespectively, as of March 31, 2023 .\\nNote 5.

On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the \\nGeneral Court, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into \\ncompliance with the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion  for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. \\nOn November 10, 2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the \\nEuropean Court of Justice on January 20, 2022.\\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related distribution \\nagreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion  ($5.1 billion  as of June 30, \\n2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, \\nand on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. On September \\n14, 2022, the General Court reduced the fine from €4.3 billion  to €4.1 billion . We subsequently filed an appeal with \\nthe European Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion  for the fine, which we reduced by \\n$217 million  in 2022.\\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that \\nGoogle had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine \\nof €1.5 billion  ($1.7 billion  as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' \\nagreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision, which \\nremains pending. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion  for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition \\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. For example: \\n•In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) \\nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our \\nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging \\nthat Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. Further, in June 2022, \\nthe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's Competition and \\nMarkets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\\n•On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District \\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state \\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. Additionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along \\nwith a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint alleging that Google’s digital \\nadvertising technology products violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional \\nstate Attorneys General joined the complaint. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal \\ninvestigation into Google's advertising technology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and \\nJune 29, 2022, respectively.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n25\"),\n",

In May 2022, the EC and the CMA \\neach opened investigations into Google Play’s business practices. Korean regulators are investigating \\nGoogle Play's billing practices, most recently opening a formal review in May 2022 of Google's compliance \\nwith the new app store billing regulations.\\nWe believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate \\nwith federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that \\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in \\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or \\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have \\nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss \\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has \\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC \\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important \\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing \\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against \\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such \\nclaims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In \\naddition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a \\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\\nOther\\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent \\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and \\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or \\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we currently \\nhave a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions.  We also periodically have \\ndata incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, lawsuits, regulatory and \\ngovernment investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders could result in substantial fines and penalties, \\ninjunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to \\nour business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of \\nwhich could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding \\npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including \\nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\\nNon-Income Taxes\\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. \\nThe subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied \\nto the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We \\naccrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax \\nauthorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and \\nthe loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity \\nand uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially \\ndifferent from our expectations.\\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 13 .Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n26\"),\n",

These non-GAAP financial measures \\nalso facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons \\nto our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both \\nbecause (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and \\noperational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help \\nthem analyze the health of our business.\\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these \\nlimitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial \\nmeasures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in \\naccordance with GAAP.\\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned “Reconciliation from \\nnet cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow” and “Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP \\nconstant currency revenues and GAAP percentage change in revenues to non-GAAP percentage change in \\nconstant currency revenues” included at the end of this release.\\nContact\\nInvestor relations Media\\ninvestor-relations@abc.xyz press@abc.xyz\\n4'),\n",

The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be \\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in \\naccordance with GAAP.\\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to \\nevaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful \\nsupplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be \\nindicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign \\nexchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that \\nboth management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our \\nperformance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures \\nalso facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons \\nto our competitors’ operating results.

BUSINESS\\nOverview\\nAs our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders\\' letter, \"Google is not a conventional company. \\nWe do not intend to become one.\" That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history, inspiring \\nus to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots . It led us to be a pioneer in the development of AI and, since 2016, \\nan AI-first company. We continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO, Sundar Pichai.\\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, \\nGoogle Services  and Google Cloud, and all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Alphabet\\'s structure is \\nabout helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence. \\nAccess and Technology for Everyone\\nThe Internet is one of the world’s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people, and businesses large and \\nsmall. Our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant \\ntoday as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find \\nanswers to a company that also helps people get things done. \\nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools \\nthey need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search  helps people find information \\nand make sense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year. \\nYouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new. Google Assistant \\noffers the best way to get things done seamlessly across different devices, providing intelligent help throughout a \\nperson\\'s day, no matter where they are. Google Cloud helps customers solve today’s business challenges, improve \\nproductivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines. We are continually innovating and building new products \\nand features that will help our users, partners, customers, and communities and have invested more than $150 billion \\nin research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts .\\nMaking AI H elpful for Everyone\\nAI is a transformational technology that can bring meaningful and positive change to people and societies across \\nthe world, and for our business. At Google, we have been bringing AI into our products and services for more than a \\ndecade and making them available to our users. Our journey began in 2001, when machine learning was first \\nincorporated into Google Search to suggest better spellings to users searching the web. Today, AI in our products is Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n4.  '),\n",

This led to the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, or BERT, in 2019 that helped \\nSearch understand the intent of user search queries better than ever before.\\nGoogle was a company built in the cloud, and we continue to invest in our Google Cloud offerings, including \\nGoogle Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, to help organizations stay at the forefront of AI innovation with our AI-\\noptimized infrastructure, mature AI platform and world-class models, and assistive agents.\\nWe believe AI can solve some of the hardest societal, scientific and engineering challenges of our time. For \\nexample, in 2020, Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold system solved a 50-year-old protein folding challenge. Since then, \\nwe have open-sourced to the scientific community 200 million of AlphaFold’s protein structures which are used to work \\non everything from accelerating new malaria vaccines to advancing cancer drug discovery and developing plastic-\\neating enzymes. As another example, AI can also have a transformative effect on climate progress by providing helpful \\ninformation, predicting climate-related events, and optimizing climate action. Using advanced AI and geospatial \\nanalysis, Google Research has developed flood forecasting models that can provide early warning and real-time \\nflooding information to communities and individuals. \\nAs AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on giving helpful features to our users and customers as we \\ndeliver on our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. With a bold \\nand responsible approach, we continue to take the next steps to make this technology even more helpful for everyone.\\nDeliver the Most Advanced, Safe, and Responsible AI\\nWe aim to build the most advanced, safe, and responsible AI with models that are developed, trained, and \\nrigorously tested at scale powered by our continued investment in AI technical infrastructure. In December 2023, we \\nlaunched Gemini, our most capable and general model. It was built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means \\nit can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information, including \\ntext, code, audio, images, and video. Our teams across Alphabet will leverage Gemini, as well as other AI models we \\nhave previously developed and announced, across our business to deliver the best product and service experience s \\nfor our use rs, advertisers, partners, customers, and developers.\\nWe believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. That means developing AI in a way that \\nmaximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing the challenges, guided by our AI P rinciples.  We published \\nthese in 2018, as one of the first companies to articulate principles that put beneficial use, users, safety, and avoidance \\nof harms above business considerations. While there is natural tension between being bold and being responsible, we \\nbelieve it is possible — and in fact critical — to embrace that tension productively.\\nEnable Organizations and Developers to Innovate on Google Cloud\\nAI is not only a powerful enabler, it is also a major platform shift. Globally, businesses from startups to large \\nenterprises, and the public sector are thinking about how to drive transformation. That is why we are focused on \\nmaking it easy and scalable for others to innovate, and grow, with AI. That means providing the most advanced \\ncomputing infrastructure and expanding access to Google’s latest AI models that have been rigorously tested in our \\nown products. Our Vertex AI platform gives developers the ability to train, tune, augment, and deploy applications using \\ngenerative AI models and services such as Enterprise Search and Conversations. Duet AI for Google Cloud provides \\npre-packaged AI agents that assist developers to write, test, document, and operate software.\\nImprove Knowledge, Learning, Creativity, and Productivity\\nThings that we now consider routine – like spell check, mobile check deposit, or Google Search, Google \\nTranslate, and Google Maps – all use AI. As AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on giving helpful features \\nto our users as we continue to deliver on our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally \\naccessible and useful.\\nWhile we have been integrating AI into our products for years, we are now embedding the power of generative AI \\nto continue helping our users express themselves and get things done. For example, Duet AI in Google Workspace \\nhelps users write, organize, visualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings. Bard allows users to \\ncollaborate with experimental AI with new features that include image capabilities, coding support, and app integration. \\nDream Screen, a new experimental feature in YouTube, allows for the creation of AI-generated video or image \\nbackgrounds to Shorts by typing an idea into a prompt.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n5.

With Performance Max, advertisers simply tell us their campaign \\ngoals and share their creative assets, and AI will automatically produce and run a highly effective ad campaign across \\nall of Google’s properties, to meet their budget. Product Studio brings the benefits of AI to businesses of all sizes, \\nhelping them easily create uniquely-tailored imagery featuring their products — for free. Additionally, we are \\nexperimenting with Search and Shopping ads that are directly integrated into the AI-powered snapshot and \\nconversational mode in Search Generative Experience.\\nBuild the Most Helpful Personal Computing Platforms and Devices\\nOver the years, our Pixel phones have incorporated AI compute directly into the device and built experiences on \\ntop of it. Our latest Pixel devices were built around AI, bringing the best AI-assistive experiences to our users, such as \\nBest Take, Magic Editor, and Audio Magic Eraser. As we look ahead, we are designing our Android and Chrome \\noperating systems with new AI-forward user experiences. \\nMoonshots\\nMany companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This \\nincrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not \\nevolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome, \\nbut those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. \\nOur early investments in AI started out as moonshots but are now incorporated into our core products and central to \\nfuture developments. We continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term , most notably for the \\napplication of AI to our  products and services , as well as other frontier technolog ies such as quantum computing . As \\nwe said in the original founders' letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in, as \\nthey are the key to our long-term success.\\nPrivacy and Security\\nWe make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are \\nnear-term financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default; \\nstrictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that \\nput people in control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete \\ntheir data, giving them tools, such as My Ad Center, to control their ad experience, or advancing anti-malware, anti-\\nphishing, and password security features.\\nGoogle\\nFor reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\\nGoogle Services\\nServing Our Users\\nWe have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people \\nworldwide. Our product innovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most \\nrecognized in the world. Google Services' core products and platforms include  ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Gmail, \\nGoogle Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube , with broad and growing adoption by \\nusers around the world.\\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than 25 years ago. \\nWhile Google Search started as a way to find web pages, organized into ten blue links, we have driven technical \\nadvancements and product innovations that have transformed Google Search into a dynamic, multimodal experience. \\nWe first expanded from traditional desktop browsers into mobile web search, making it easier to navigate on smaller \\nscreens. As new types of content surfaced on the internet, Universal Search made it possible to search multiple \\ncontent types, like news, images, videos, and more, to deliver rich, relevant results. The introduction of new search \\nmodalities, like voice and visual search, made it easier for people to express their curiosity in natural and intuitive \\nways. We took that a step further with multisearch, which lets people search with text and images at the same time. \\nLarge language models like BERT and Multitask Unified Models, or MUMs, have made it possible to express more \\nnatural language queries, vastly improving the quality of results. Each advancement has made it easier and more \\nnatural for people to find what they are looking for.\\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery \\nand creation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. People are \\nconsuming many forms of digital content, including watching  videos, streaming TV , playing games, listening to music, Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n6.  \"),\n",

Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide \\nrange of products across devices and formats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads \\nat the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies. AI has been foundational to our \\nadvertising business for more than a decade. Products like Performance Max and Product Studio use the full power of \\nour AI to help advertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities.\\nGoogle Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears \\non Google Search & other properties, YouTube, and Google Network partners\\' properties (\"Google Network \\nproperties\"). We continue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of \\nadvertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.\\n•Performance advertising  creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct \\nengagement with advertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving \\nmeasurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.\\n•Brand advertising  helps enhance users\\' awareness of and affinity for advertisers\\' products and services, \\nthrough videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand \\nadvertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing \\ncampaigns. \\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. \\nWe focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering \\nout invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and \\nvideos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\\nIn addition, Google S ervices increasingly generates revenues from products and services beyond advertising, \\nincluding:\\n•consumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube  services , such as YouTube TV, \\nYouTube Music and Premium ,  and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\\n•platforms , which  primarily include  revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases; \\nand\\n•device s, which  primar ily include sales of the Pixel family of device s.\\nGoogle Cloud\\nThrough our Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace offerings, Google Cloud generates revenues \\nprimarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, collaboration tools and other \\ncloud services. Customers use five key capabilities from Google Cloud.\\n•AI-optimized Infrastructure:  provides open, reliable, and scalable compute, networking, and storage to \\nenable customers to run workloads anywhere — on our Cloud, at the edge, or in their data centers. It can be \\nused to migrate and modernize IT systems and to train and serve various types of AI models. \\n•Cybersecurity:  helps customers detect, protect, and respond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats, with \\nAI integrated to further strengthen  security outcomes, prioritize which threats to investigate, and identify attack \\npaths, as well as accelerate resolution of cybersecurity threats. \\n•Databases and Analytics:  provides a variety of different types of databases — relational, key-value, in-\\nmemory — to store and manage data for different types of applications.

Alphabet’s \\ninvestment in the portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses that are at various stages of development, ranging from \\nthose in the R&D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become \\nthriving, successful businesses. Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own \\nboards with independent members and outside investors. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with \\nconsiderable uncertainty, s ome of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their \\nindustries.  Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet \\nservices.\\nCompetition\\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable \\ncompetition in every aspect of our business, including, among others, from:\\n•general purpose search engines and information services;\\n•vertical search engines and e-commerce providers for queries related to travel, jobs, and health, which users \\nmay navigate directly to rather than go through Google;\\n•online advertising platforms and networks;\\n•other forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television as our advertisers \\ntypically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline;\\n•digital content and application platform providers;\\n•providers of enterprise cloud services;\\n•developers  and providers of AI products and services ;\\n•companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that \\nhave developed proprietary platforms;\\n•providers of digital video services; \\n•social networks, which users may rely on for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information \\nthrough traditional search engines;\\n•providers of workspace communication and connectivity products; and \\n•digital assistant providers .\\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and \\ntechnologies to the marketplace across our businesses. For example, for advertising, competing successfully depends \\non attracting and retaining:\\n•users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance \\nof our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\\n•advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver \\ntheir advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\\n•content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners \\ngenerate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n8.

Sustainability is one of \\nour core values at Google, and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. We have been a leader on \\nsustainability and climate change since Google’s founding more than 25 years ago. \\nOur sustainability work is focused on empowering individuals to take action, working together with our partners \\nand customers, and working to reduce  our carbon footprint across our operations and supply chain .\\nIn 2020, we shared our aspiration to help individuals, cities, and other partners collectively reduce one gigaton of \\ntheir carbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030. This is an ambitious vision that we have set to push us to \\ncontribute meaningfully to helping with climate solutions beyond our own operations and value chain.  \\nIn 2021, we set an ambitious goal to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain, by \\n2030. To accomplish this, we aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 \\nabsolute emissions (versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030, and plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based \\ncarbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions. We have formally committed to the Science Based \\nTargets initiative to seek their validation of our absolute emissions reduction  target. \\nOne of the key levers for reducing emissions from our operations is transitioning to clean energy.  Since 2017, we \\nhave matched 100% of the electricity consumption of our global operations with purchases of renewable energy on an \\nannual basis. However, because of differences in the availability of renewable energy sources like solar and wind \\nacross the regions where we operate—and because of the variable supply of these resources—we still need to rely on \\ncarbon-emitting energy sources that power local grids. That is why we set a goal to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy \\n(CFE) on every grid where we operate by 2030.\\nAchieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals. We also know that our path \\nto net-zero emissions w ill not be easy or linear. Some of our plans may take years to deliver results, particularly where \\nthey involve building new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. So as our business continues to evolve, we \\nexpect our emissions to rise before dropping towards our absolute emissions reduction target.\\nTo benefit the people and places where we operate, we have set goals to replenish 120% of the freshwater \\nvolume we consume, on average, across our offices and data centers by 2030 and to help restore and improve the \\nquality of water and health of ecosystems in the communities where we operate. \\nWe also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains.  Our \\ncircularity principles focus on designing out waste from the start, keeping materials in use for as long as possible, and \\npromoting healthy materials—for our data centers, workplaces, and products.\\nMore information on our approach to sustainability can be found in our annual sustainability reports, including \\nGoogle’s Environmental Report. The contents of our sustainability reports are not incorporated by reference into this \\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC. For additional information about \\nrisks and uncertainties applicable to our commitments to attain certain sustainability goals, see Item 1A Risk Factors of \\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nCulture and Workforce\\nWe are a company of curious, talented, and passionate people. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and \\nencourage the iteration of ideas to address complex challenges in technology and society.\\nOur people are critical for our continued success, so we work hard to create an environment where employees \\ncan have fulfilling careers, and be happy, healthy, and productive. We offer industry-leading benefits and programs to \\ntake care of the diverse needs of our employees and their families, including opportunities for career growth and \\ndevelopment, resources to support their financial health, and access to excellent healthcare choices. Our competitive \\ncompensation programs help us to attract and retain top candidates, and we will continue to invest in recruiting \\ntalented people to technical and non-technical roles, and rewarding them well. We provide a variety of high quality \\ntraining and support to managers to build and strengthen their capabilities-–ranging from courses for new managers, to \\nlearning resources that help them provide feedback and manage performance, to coaching and individual support.\\nAt Alphabet, we are committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a \\nworkforce that is representative of the users we serve.

RISK FACTORS\\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to \\nthose described below, which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, and affect \\nthe trading price of our Class A and Class C stock.\\nRisks Specific to our Company\\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, a \\nloss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize \\nads could harm our business. \\nWe generated more than 75% of total  revenues from online advertising in 2023. Many of our advertisers, \\ncompanies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their \\ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value \\n(such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective \\nmonetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practice s, such as \\nour initiatives to phase out third-party cookies,  as well as changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy \\npractices have in the past, and may in the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, \\ntechnologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, \\nand some providers of online services have integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability \\nand functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively \\nand competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse \\nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in \\nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and \\noperating results. \\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that \\nare useful to users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our \\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results. \\nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing \\ntechnologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, \\nwe must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, \\nand technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a \\nwider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in technical infrastructure and \\nR&D, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology, products , and services . \\nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international \\ncompetitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer \\noperating histories and well-established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources \\nin ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions  and entering into other strategic \\narrangements ; continuing to invest heavily in technical infrastructure, R&D, and in talent;  initiating intellectual property \\nand competition claims (whether or not meritorious); and continuing to compete for users, advertisers, customers, and \\ncontent providers. Further, discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to \\naggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive advantages. Our \\ncompetitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the \\nneed for products and services before we do. \\nWe are expanding our investment in AI across the entire company . This includes generative AI and continuing to \\nintegrate AI capabilities into our products and services. AI technology and services are highly competitive, rapidly \\nevolving, and require significant investment, including development and operational costs, to meet the changing needs \\nand expectations of our existing users and attract new users. Our ability to deploy certain AI technologies critical for \\nour products and services and for our business strategy may depend on the availability and pricing of third-party \\nequipment and technical infrastructure. Additionally, other companies may develop AI products and technologies that \\nare similar or superior to our technologies or more cost-effective to deploy. Other companies may also have (or in the \\nfuture may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, \\nor sell our own AI products and services.\\nOur financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the \\nevolving needs and desires of our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. As new and \\nexisting technologies continue to develop, competitors and new entrants may be able to offer experiences that are, or Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n11.  '),\n",

These technologies could reduce usage of our products \\nand services, and force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources to develop and operate equal \\nor better products and services. Competitors’ success in providing compelling products and services or in attracting \\nand retaining users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers could harm our financial condition and \\noperating results. \\nOur ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies  is inherently risky, and \\ncould divert management attention and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services,  and technologies in a \\nwide range of industries beyond online advertising. The investments that we are making across our businesses, such \\nas building AI capabilities into new and existing products and services , reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and \\nprovide products and services that are helpful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers . Our \\ninvestments ultimately  may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in \\npursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated liabilities. Innovations in our products and services could also \\nresult in changes to user behavior and affect our revenue trends. These endeavors involve significant risks and \\nuncertainties, including diversion of resources and management attention from current operations, different \\nmonetization models, and the use of alternative investment, governance, or compensation structures that may fail to \\nadequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.\\nWithin Google Services , we continue to invest heavily in devices , including our smartphones, home devices,  and \\nwearables, which is a highly competitive market  with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid \\nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, increased market saturation in developed countries, short \\nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in performance characteristics, and price and \\nfeature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.  There can be no assurance we will be able to provide \\ndevices  that compete  effectively. \\nWithin Google Cloud , we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services, \\nincluding Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, and we are advancing our AI platforms and models to \\nsupport these tools and technologies. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud \\ncomputing services, invest in cybersecurity, and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our sales force. At the \\nsame time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models \\nare competitive and constantly evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business \\nobjectives. Further, our business with public sector customers may present additional risks, including regulatory \\ncompliance risks. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and cost reviews, and any failure to comply or \\nany deficiencies found may expose us to legal, financial, and/or reputational risks. Evolving laws and regulations may \\nrequire us to make new capital investments, build new products, and seek partners to deliver localized services in \\nother countries, and we may not be able to meet sovereign operating requirements. \\nWithin Other Bets, we are investing significantly in the areas of health, life sciences, and transportation, among \\nothers. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors, and \\nour offerings, many of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies, may not be successful, or be \\nable to compete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability. \\nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI, raise ethical, technological, \\nlegal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and \\nservices. Because all of these investment areas are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies \\nand offerings will be successful or will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time , and we may experience  downward pressure on our \\noperating margin in the future. \\nOur revenue growth rate  could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including changes in the \\ndevices and modalities used to access our products and services; changes in geographic mix; deceleration or declines \\nin advertiser spending; competition; customer usage and demand for our products; decreases in our pricing of our \\nproducts and services; ongoing product and policy changes; and shifts to lower priced products and services.  \\nIn addition, we may experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors, \\nsuch as an increase in the mix of lower-margin products and services, in particular from the continued expansion of our \\nbusiness into new fields, including products and services such as our devices , Google Cloud, and consumer  \\nsubscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than those \\nwe generate from advertising. In particular, margins on our device s have had, and may continue to have, an adverse \\neffect on our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales. We may also experience Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n12.  '),\n",

Further, certain of our costs and expenses are generally less variable in nature and \\nmay not correlate to changes in revenue. W e may  also not be able to execute our efforts to re-engineer our cost base \\nsuccessfully or in a timely manner. Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue \\ngrowth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance. For additional information, \\nsee Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect and Revenues and Monetization Metrics in Part II, Item 7 of this \\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. \\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of \\nour products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete. \\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for \\nus. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, \\nservices, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country \\nin which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have \\ntaken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection \\nfor our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have \\nadequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the \\npossibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or \\nunenforceable. \\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and \\nother sensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting \\nfrom these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word \\n“Google” could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word “search.” Some courts have \\nruled that \"Google\" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S., \\nmay reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in \\nother people using the word “Google” to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand. \\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. \\nAlso, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of \\nour intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating \\nresults. \\nOur business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our \\nability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. \\nOur strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the \\nbrands within Google Service s, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch \\nnew and innovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content \\nproviders, and other partners. Our brands have been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by a number of \\nfactors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and \\nsecurity issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures.  For example, if we fail to respond \\nappropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable \\npractices by advertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our \\nbrands. \\nFurthermore, failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, \\nand operating results. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to \\nprovide high-quality, trustworthy, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a \\nrange of settings. \\nWe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial \\ncondition, and operating results. \\nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability \\nto supply both our products and our services. \\nWe rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our device s and servers and networking \\nequipment used in our technical infrastructure, and we may supply the contract manufacturers with components to \\nassemble t he device s and equipment. We also rely on other companies to participate in the  supply of components and  \\ndistribution of our products and services.

Some of the components we use in our technical infrastructure and our device s \\nare available from only one or limited sources, and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms \\nin the event of a supply chain disruption. A significant supply interruption that affects us or our vendors could delay \\ncritical data center upgrades or expansions and delay consumer product availability . \\nWe may enter into long-term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and \\nconditions. We may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand, technological \\nchange, changed consumer preferences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain of \\nour hardware  supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of sales \\nof our devices decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing \\ncosts or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and harm our \\nfinancial condition and operating results. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable \\ncontractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and \\nmay affect our supply. \\nOur device s have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing, or \\noperations. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or \\nsuppliers. If the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or services are \\ndefective or require a recall, it could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.  \\nWe require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies \\nand practices, such as the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data \\nsecurity, environmental compliance, and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. \\nViolations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm to key \\nrelationships, and damage to our reputation. Their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property \\ncould affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims. \\nInterruption to, interference with, or failure of our complex information technology and communications \\nsystems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm  our \\nreputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nThe availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing \\noperation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage, \\ninterference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, state-sponsored attacks, natural disasters \\nor pandemics, geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, export controls and sanctions, the effects of climate change \\n(such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns  \\nassociated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, utility outages, telecommunications \\nfailures, computer viruses, software bugs, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, computer denial of service \\nattacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems. Some of our data centers are located in \\nareas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, \\nsabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and, in some cases, to potential disruptions resulting from problems \\nexperienced by facility operators or disruptions as a result of geopolitical tensions and conflicts happening in the area. \\nSome of our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The \\noccurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic, closure of a facility, or other unanticipated problems affecting our data \\ncenters could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical \\nand complex and have contained in the past, and may contain in the future, errors or vulnerabilities, which could result \\nin interruptions in or failure of our services or systems. Any of these incidents could impede or prevent us from \\neffectively offering products and providing services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating \\nresults. \\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, financial \\ncondition, and operating results.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n14.

International revenues accounted for approximately 53% of our consolidated revenues in 2023. In \\naddition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the \\nfollowing:\\n•restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent \\nus from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;\\n•sanctions, import and export controls, other market access barriers, political unrest, geopolitical tensions, \\nchanges in regimes, or armed conflict (such as ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine), any of which \\nmay affect our business continuity, increase our operating costs, limit demand for our products and services, \\nlimit our ability to source components or final products, or prevent or impede us from  operating in certain \\njurisdictions , complying with local laws, or offering products or services;\\n•longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud;\\n•an evolving foreign policy landscape that may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to litigation, \\nnew regulatory costs and challenges (including new customer requirements), uncertainty regarding regulatory \\noutcomes, and other liabilities under local laws that may not offer due process or clear legal precedent;\\n•anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain \\npayments to government officials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties; and\\n•different employee/employer relationships, existence of works councils and differing labor practices, and other \\nchallenges caused by distance, language, local expertise, and cultural differences, increasing the complexity \\nof doing business in multiple jurisdictions.\\nBecause we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, \\nwe have faced, and will continue to face, exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although we \\nhedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. \\ndollar and foreign currencies  have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our revenues and earnings. \\nHedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial \\ncondition and operating results. \\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and, in some instances, our financial \\nstatements incorporate inherently subjective valuation methodologies. \\nThe fair value of our debt and equity investments may in the future be, and certain investments have been in the \\npast, negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, performance and financial results of the underlying \\nentities, foreign exchange rates, changes in interest rates, including changes that may result from the implementation \\nof new benchmark rates, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market in general, or other factors. \\nWe measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt securities, certain other instruments including stock-\\nbased compensation awards settled in the stock of  Other Bet  companies, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in \\na business combination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, which is inherently subjective and requires management \\njudgment and estimation. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in OI&E, which \\nincreases the volatility of our OI&E. The unrealized gains and losse s or impairments we record from fair value \\nremeasurements in any particular period may differ significantly from the gains or losses we ultimately realize on such \\ninvestments.  \\nAs a res ult of these factors, the value of our investments could decline, which could harm our financial condition \\nand operating results. \\nRisks Related to our Industry \\nPeople access our products and services through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to \\nevolve with the advancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely \\nadopt versions of our products and services developed for these interfaces, our business could be harmed. \\nPeople access our products and services through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers, \\nmobile phones, smartphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables \\n(including virtual reality and augmented reality devices), automobiles, and television-streaming devices.

It is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter \\nin adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. We expect to continue \\nto devote significant resources to creating and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices. \\nFailing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and \\nusers, or failing to develop products and technologies that work well on new devices and platforms, could harm our \\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results and ability to capture future business opportunities. \\nIssues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational harm and increased liability exposure. \\nOur evolving AI-related efforts may give rise to risks related to harmful content, inaccuracies, discrimination, \\nintellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity, and other issues . As a \\nresult of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies, our implementation of AI systems could \\nsubject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability (including under new and proposed legislation and \\nregulations), new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or \\nreputational harm. \\nSome uses of AI will present ethical issues and may have broad effects on society. In order to implement A I \\nresponsibly and minimize unintended harmful effects, we have already devoted and will continue to invest significant  \\nresources to develop, test, and maintain our products and services, but we may not be able to identify or resolve all AI-\\nrelated issues, deficiencies, and/or failures before they arise. Unintended consequences, uses, or customization of our \\nAI tools and systems may negatively affect human rights, privacy, employment, or other social concerns, which may \\nresult in claims, lawsuits, brand or reputational harm, and increased regulatory scrutiny, any of which could harm our \\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results.\\nData privacy  and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could harm our \\nreputation, cause us to incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from \\nusing our products and services.

Such efforts have \\naffected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading, \\nor undesirable content.

Internet \\naccess providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and \\nservices, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers. \\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products \\nrequire significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant \\nmarket power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable \\ncompanies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers \\nhave taken, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user \\naccess to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our \\nofferings, by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, or by providing our competitors \\npreferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet \\naccess providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections. For \\nexample, in 2018 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules, which could permit \\ninternet access providers to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services. In \\naddition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or \\nblockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, advertisers, and/or \\ncontent providers, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby \\nnegatively affecting our business. \\nRisks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies \\nWe are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could \\nharm our business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue \\nto expand our business. \\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects, and our \\nintroduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies will likely continue to subject us to additional laws \\nand regulations. In recent years, governments around the world have proposed and adopted a large number of new \\nlaws and regulations relevant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data privacy and security, competition, \\nenvironmental, social and governance (ESG) requirements, AI, and online content. The costs of compliance with these \\nmeasures are high and are likely to increase in the future. \\nNew or changing laws and regulations, or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a \\nmanner inconsistent with our practices, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, less useful products and \\nservices, altered business practices, limited ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and \\nservices, substantial costs, and civil or criminal liability.

For example, while \\nlegislative text has yet to be finalized and formally approved, provisional political agreement on a proposed EU \\nAI Act was reached between co-legislators in December 2023, including that specific transparency and other \\nrequirements would be introduced for general purpose AI systems and the models on which those systems are \\nbased.  In addition, the White House's Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and \\nUse of Artificial Intelligence devises a framework for the U.S. government, among other things, to regulate \\nprivate sector use and development of certain foundation models. \\n•Data privacy, collection, and processing:  Laws and regulations further restricting the collection, processing, \\nand/or sharing of user or advertising-related data, including privacy and data protection laws; laws affecting the \\nprocessing of children's data (as discussed further below), data breach notification laws, and laws limiting data \\ntransfers (including data localization laws). \\n•Copyright and other intellectual property : Copyright and related laws, including the EU Directive on \\nCopyright in the Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions, which may introduce new \\nlicensing regimes, increase liability with respect to content uploaded by users or  linked to from our platforms,  \\nor create property rights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and publishers, \\nwhich may result in other regulatory actions . \\n•Content  moderation : Various laws covering content moderation and removal, and related disclosure \\nobligations, such as the EU's Digital Services Act, Florida’s Senate Bill 7072 and Texas’ House Bill 20, and \\nlaws and proposed legislation in Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure \\nto remove certain types of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and \\nalgorithms, which may make it harder for services like Google Search and YouTube to detect and deal with \\nlow-quality, deceptive, or harmful content.\\n•Consumer  protection : Consumer protection laws, including the EU’s New Deal for Consumers, which could \\nresult in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.\\nIn addition, the applicability and scope of these and other laws and regulations, as interpreted by courts , \\nregulators, or administrative bodies, remain uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. For \\nexample, we rely on statutory safe harbors, like those set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 \\nof the Communications Decency Act in the U.S. and the E-Commerce Directive in Europe, to protect against liability for \\nvarious linking, caching, ranking, recommending, and hosting activities. Legislation or court rulings affecting these safe \\nharbors may adversely affect us and may impose significant operational challenges. There are legislative proposals \\nand pending litigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for \\nwebsites and online platforms. Our development, use, and commercialization of AI products and services (including \\nour implementation of AI in our offerings and internal systems) could subject us to regulatory action and legal liability, \\nincluding under specific legislation regulating AI, as well as new applications of existing data protection, cybersecurity, \\nprivacy, intellectual property, and other laws.\\nWe are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, \\nenforcement actions, consent orders, and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability that could harm \\nour business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and orders \\ninvolving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and \\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or \\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, and other matters.

In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice, \\nvarious U.S. states, and other plaintiffs have filed several antitrust lawsuits about various aspects of our business, \\nincluding our advertising technologies and practices, the operation and distribution of Google Search, and the \\noperation and distribution of the Android operating system and Play Store.

Parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts \\nand the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. In addition, patent-\\nholding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims \\nagainst us.

They may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues \\nfor us and otherwise harm our business. \\nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend \\nagainst certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual \\nproperty infringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or \\nsignificant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also \\ndiscontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could \\nresult in loss of revenues and harm our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our \\nsuppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from \\nintellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in \\nthe future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual \\nproperty claims.

Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and \\ndoes not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. \\nFurther, our share repurchases could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves \\nand may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock. \\nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters. \\nOur Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has \\nno voting rights. As of December 31, 2023, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 86.5% of our \\noutstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately  51.5%  of the voting power of our outstanding common \\nstock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring \\nstockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or \\nother sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no \\nvoting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based \\nacquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey’s current \\nrelative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters \\nsubmitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also \\naffect Larry and Sergey’s relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders’ \\nability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, \\nwhich could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock. \\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that \\nstockholders may consider favorable. \\nProvisions in Alphabet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a \\nchange of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following: \\n•Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of \\nDirectors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director.\\n•Our stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding \\na stockholders' meeting.\\n•Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors.

These broad market and industry factors could harm the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C \\nstock, regardless of our actual operating performance. \\nGeneral Risks \\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our \\nresults to fall short of expectations. \\nOur operating results have fluctuated, and may in the future fluctuate, as a result of a number of factors, many \\noutside of our control, including the cyclical nature and seasonality in our business and geopolitical events. As a result, \\ncomparing our operating results (including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues) on a period-to-period basis \\nmay not be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance. \\nConsequently, our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. \\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, \\nand other consequences that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy \\nand use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. We expect \\nto continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic arrangements, \\nwhich could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Some of the areas where we face risks include: \\n•diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and \\nother strategic arrangements; \\n•failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions \\nplaced upon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or \\notherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction;\\n•failure to successfully integrate the acquired operations, technologies, services, and personnel (including \\ncultural integration and retention of employees) and further develop the acquired business or technology; \\n•implementation of controls (or remediation of control deficiencies), procedures, and policies at the acquired \\ncompany; \\n•integration of the acquired company’s accounting and other administrative systems, and the coordination of \\nproduct, engineering, and sales and marketing functions;\\n•transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms;\\n•in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages \\nand to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific \\ncountries; \\n•failure to accomplish commercial, strategic or financial objectives with respect to investments, joint ventures, \\nand other strategic arrangements;\\n•failure to realize the value of investments and joint ventures due to a lack of liquidity;Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n23.  \"),\n",

In \\nconnection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain \\npotential liabilities, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. \\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire \\nqualified personnel, or maintain and continue to adapt our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow or \\noperate effectively. \\nOur performance and future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key technical leads as \\nwell as  members of our senior management team. For instance, Sundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of \\nAlphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an important role in the development of our technology, maintaining our \\nculture, and setting our strategic direction. \\nOur ability to compete effectively and our future success depend  on our continuing to identify, hire, develop, \\nmotivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified \\nemployees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted, and may continue to target, our \\nemployees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be \\nsuccessful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Restrictive immigration \\npolicy and regulatory changes may also affect our ability to hire, mobilize, or retain some of our global talent. All of our \\nexecutive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance \\npolicies.\\nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization \\ngrows and evolves, we may need to adapt our corporate culture and work environments to ever-changing \\ncircumstances, such as during times of a natural disaster or pandemic, and these changes could affect our ability to \\ncompete effectively or have an adverse effect on our corporate culture.

Discussion of 2022 results \\ncompared to 2021  results to the extent not included in this report can be found in Item 7 of our 2022  Annual Report on \\nForm 10-K .\\nUnderstanding Alphabet’s Financial Results\\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, \\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For \\nadditional information on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 Business and Note 15  of the Notes to Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect\\nThe following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate \\nthat they will continue to affect our future results:\\n•Users\\' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves .\\nThe continuing evolution of the online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues since \\ninception. We expect that this evolution will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although at a slower \\npace than we have experienced historically, in particular after the outsized growth in our advertising revenues during \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and advertisers, which may \\naffect our revenues.\\n•Users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which \\nallows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.\\nOur users are accessing our products and services via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, \\nwearables, connected TVs, and smart home devices , and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or \\nwhat they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to \\nmaintain and grow our business.\\nWe benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising \\nformats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional \\ndesktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues \\nmay be affected. For example, chang ing dynamics within  the global smartphone market, such as increased market \\nsaturation in developed countries, can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow \\nand TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic \\nmix; partner agreement terms; partner mix; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product \\nmix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.\\n•As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our \\nmonetization.\\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to \\nexpand our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect our monetization. For example, \\nrevenues from ads on YouTube and Google Play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads. We also \\nexpect to continue to incorporate AI innovations into our products, such as AI in Searc h, that could affect our \\nmonetization trends.  When developing new products and services we generally focus first on user experience and then \\non monetization.\\n•As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets \\ncontinue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange \\nrates affect such revenues. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n29.  '),\n",

We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our \\nproducts and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased \\nrevenues from emerging markets.  We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these \\nmarkets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as \\ndeveloping markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\\nInternational revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign \\ncurrency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program \\ndesigned to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues \\nand earnings.\\n•The revenues that we derive beyond advertising  are increasing and may adversely affect our margins.\\nRevenues  from cloud, consumer subscriptions, platforms, and devices, which may have differing characteristics \\nthan our advertising revenues,  have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding \\nour products and services . The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins \\non our advertising revenues.  For example,  sales of our device s  adversely affect our consolidated margins due to \\npressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.\\n•As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily  in operating and \\ncapital expenditures.\\nWe continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to \\ndevelop new, innovative offerings, improve our existing offerings, a nd rapidly and responsibly deploy AI  across our \\nbusinesses.

In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the \\nbreadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and build strong \\npartnerships around strategic initiatives .\\n•We continue to face an evolving regulatory environment, and we are subject to claims, lawsuits, \\ninvestigations, and other forms of potential legal liability, which could affect our business practices and \\nfinancial results.\\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws  and policies governing a wide \\nrange of topics and related legal matters, including investigations, lawsuits, and regulatory actions, have resulted in \\nfines and caused us to change our business practices . As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may \\nincrease, our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited, and we \\nmay need to change our business practices to comply with evolving regulatory and legal matters . Examples include t he \\nantitrust complaints filed by  the U.S. Department of Justice and a number of state Attorneys General; legislative \\nproposals and pending litigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor \\nprotection for websites and online platforms; and the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act in Europe and various \\nlegislative proposals in the U.S. focused on large technology platforms.

These adjustments \\nrequire quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of unobservable inputs. \\nAdjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and involve the use of \\nestimates using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data .\\nNon-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the \\ncompanies\\' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. When indicators of \\nimpairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market \\napproach or an income approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount \\nrates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others.

Significant judgment is required in evaluating \\nour uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\\nRecording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of \\ncomparable and resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain \\ntax positions periodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial \\nopinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately \\nreserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not \\nbe different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such \\ndifferences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination \\nis made.\\nThe provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the \\nrelated net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns \\nby the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of \\nadverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for \\nincome taxes .\\nLoss Contingencies\\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and \\nconsent orders involving competition, intellectual property, privacy, data security , tax and related compliance, labor and \\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or \\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury consumer protection,  and other matters. Certain of these matters \\ninclude speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe \\nthat it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a \\nloss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss  in Note 10  of \\nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \\nWe evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that \\nhas been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make \\nadjustments and changes to our disclosures.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, \\nand equity investment risks. \\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. International revenues, as well as costs and expenses \\ndenominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the \\nU.S. dollar. As discussed below, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency risk. Principal \\ncurrencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, and Japanese yen.  For the \\npurpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange \\nrates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be \\nexperienced .\\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities \\ndenominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward and option contracts \\nreduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and \\nliabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in OI&E, which are offset \\nby the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts.\\nIf an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets, liabilities, and \\ncommitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would have \\nresulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approxima tely $136 million  and $503 million  as of \\nDecember 31, 2022  and 2023 , respectively, after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for \\nthe years ended December 31, 2022  and 2023 .\\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a \\ncombination of purchased and written options) to protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in \\nforeign currency exchange rates.  When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option \\ncontacts reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign \\ncurrency forward and option contracts offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging \\ncontracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate \\nthese contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot \\nrate changes as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them \\ninto revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur. \\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2022  and 2023 , the amount recorded in AOCI related to \\nour cash flow hedges before tax effect would have been approximately  $1.3 billion  and  $1.5 billion  lower as of \\nDecember 31, 2022  and 2023 , respectively. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a \\ncorresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.\\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency \\nrisks related to investment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency \\ntranslation risk from our foreign operations.\\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI \\nrelated to our net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $903 million  and $946 million  \\nlower as of December 31, 2022  and 2023 , respectively. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to \\noffset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that w ill allow us to preserve capital and \\nmaintain liquidity. We invest primarily in debt securities, including government bonds, corporate debt securities, \\nmortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, money market and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate \\nderivatives. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and \\nfloating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair \\nmarket value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income \\nthan predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to \\ninterest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt \\nsecurities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. We measure \\nsecurities for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until \\nthe securities are sold, less any expected credit losses.

The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for \\nour investment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with \\n95% confidence interval.

VaR analysis is \\nnot intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation.\\nEquity Investment Risk\\nOur marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that \\ncould substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.\\nOur marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are \\ninvestments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages.\\nWe record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily \\ndeterminable market values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and \\nrepresent $5.2 billion  and $6.0 billion  of our investments as of December 31, 2022  and 2023 , respectively. A \\nhypothetical adverse price change of 10% on our December 31, 2023  balance would decrease the fair value of \\nmarketable equity securities by $597 million . From time to time, we may enter into derivatives to hedge the market \\nprice risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.\\nOur non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for \\nobservable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the \\nmeasurement alternative). The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an \\nindication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are in the \\nearly stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are \\ntypically in the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience a decline in financial condition, \\nwhich could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. Valuations of our equity \\ninvestments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data and \\nobservable transactions at lower valuations could result in significant losses. In addition, global economic conditions \\ncould result in additional volatility. The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on \\nthe likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of investments through liquidity events such as public \\nofferings, acquisitions, private sales or other market events. Changes in the valuation of non-marketable equity \\nsecurities may not directly correlate with changes in valuation of marketable equity securities. As of December 31, \\n2022  and 2023 , the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the \\nmeasurement alternative, was $28.5 billion  and $28.8 billion , respectively. \\nThe carrying values of our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.7 billion  as of \\nDecember 31, 2022  and 2023 , generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However, these investments \\ncould be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.\\nFor additional information about our equity investments, see Note 1  and Note 3  of the Notes to Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n46.

In our opinion, Alphabet Inc. (the Company) maintained, \\nin all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO \\ncriteria.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United \\nStates) (PCAOB), the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated January 30, 2024 \\nexpressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \\nBasis for Opinion\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its \\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying \\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the \\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with \\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal \\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was \\nmaintained in all material respects. \\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a \\nmaterial weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on \\nthe assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We \\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding \\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with \\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies \\nand procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the \\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are \\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting \\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations \\nof management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely \\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on \\nthe financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. \\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become \\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may \\ndeteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nJanuary 30, 2024Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n50.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nNature of Operations\\nGoogle was incorporate d in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August \\n2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became \\nthe successor issuer to Google.\\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide \\nenterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales \\nof other products and services, such as  fees received for consumer subscription-based products, apps and in-app \\npurchases, and devices .\\nBasis of Consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolid ated \\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\\nUse of Estimates\\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and \\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. \\nActual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our \\nestimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; content licenses;  contingent liabilities; fair values \\nof financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inventory; and useful lives of property and equipment,  among \\nothers. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, \\nand the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and \\nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years  to six years  and the estimated useful life of certain \\nnetwork equipment from five years  to six years . This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal \\nyear 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and those \\nplaced in service during the year ended December 31, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in \\ndepreciation expense of $3.9 billion  and an increase in net income of $3.0 billion , or $0.24  per basic and $0.24  per \\ndiluted share,  for the year ended December 31, 2023.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and \\nthe collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable.  Sales and other \\nsimilar taxes are excluded from revenues. \\nAdvertising Revenues\\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\\n•Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners \\nwho use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated \\nproperties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\\n•YouTube properties; and\\n•Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, \\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, Google \\nDisplay & Video 360, and Google Marketing Platform, among others.\\nWe offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for \\nperformance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement . For brand advertising, we recognize revenues \\nwhen the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal  (i.e., report revenues on \\na gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed \\non Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n56.

Where we are the principal, we \\ncontrol the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to \\nmonetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being \\nprimarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\\nGoogle  Subscriptions, Platforms, and Device s\\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues consist of revenues from:\\n•consumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such YouTube TV, YouTube \\nMusic and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\\n•platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases;\\n•devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and\\n•other products and services.\\nSubscription revenues are recognized ratably over the period of the subscription, primarily monthly . We report \\nrevenues from Google Play app sales and in-app purchases on a net basis, because our performance obligation is to \\nfacilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a service fee. \\nGoogle Cloud Revenues\\nGoogle Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:\\n•Google Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, \\nplatform, and other services. These services provide access to solutions such as cybersecurity, databases, \\nanalytics, and AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Duet AI for Google Cloud;\\n•Google Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for \\nenterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Duet AI in Google \\nWorkspace; and\\n•other enterprise services.\\nOur cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract \\nterms longer than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when \\nthe customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services \\nprovided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and \\nconsumes the benefits of the cloud services.\\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate \\nrevenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine \\nstandalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\\nCustomer Incentives and Credits\\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. \\nWe estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We \\nbelieve that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.\\nSales Commissions\\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We \\nrecognize an asset for certain sales commissions and  amortize i f the expected benefit period is greater than one year. \\nThese costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\\nCost of Revenues\\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\\n•TAC includes: \\n◦amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. \\nOur distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, \\nand software developers; and\\n◦amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n57.

As a result, development costs \\nthat meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.\\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and \\ncloud-based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software \\napplications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the \\nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications \\nwere not material for the periods presented.\\nStock-based Compensation  \\nStock-based compensation (SBC)  primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity \\nclassified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense \\nusing the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.\\nFor RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be \\npaid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and \\nthe income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\\nAdditionally, SBC includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) that include \\nmarket conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bet companies . PSUs and  \\ncertain awards granted by Other Bet companies  are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite \\nservice period. Certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are liability classified and remeasured at fair value \\nthrough settlement. The fair value of awards granted by Other Bet companies is based on the equity valuation of the \\nrespective Other Bet company.\\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred.  For the years ended \\nDecember 31, 2021 , 2022 , and 2023 , advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $7.9 billion , $9.2 \\nbillion , and $8.7 billion , respectively.\\nPerformance Fees\\nPerformance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain \\ninvestments. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may \\nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use \\nof unobservable inputs . Performance fees are recorded as a component of OI&E.\\nFair Value Measurements \\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a \\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that \\nis determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.

Where applicable, \\nthese models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based \\nobservable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of \\nunobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate \\nvaluation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models.\\nOur financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents, \\nmarketable securities, derivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets \\nmeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and \\nliabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.\\nWe measure certain other instruments, including SBC awards settled in the stock of O ther Bet companies, and \\ncertain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. \\nFinancial Instruments\\nOur financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative \\nfinancial instruments and accounts receivable.\\nCredit Risks\\nWe are subject to credit risk primarily from cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, derivative financial \\ninstruments, including foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable.  We manage our credit risk exposure \\nthrough timely assessment of our counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits and use of collateral management. \\nForeign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts \\nreceivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. \\nWe manage our credit risk exposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the \\namount of credit we extend. We generally do not require collateral from our customers.\\nCash Equivalents\\nWe invest excess cash primarily in government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-\\nbacked securities, time deposits, and money market funds.\\nMarketable Securities\\nWe classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of \\npurchase as cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities \\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable \\ndebt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have \\nclassified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus \\nreward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their effective \\nmaturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities \\nwith maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated \\nBalance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a \\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity, except for the changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which are recorded \\nin OI&E. For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which changes in fair value \\nare recorded in OI&E. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a \\nspecific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of OI&E .\\nOur investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses, \\nincluding unrealized, recognized in OI&E.  We classify our marketable equity securities subject to long-term lock-up \\nrestrictions beyond 12 months as other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\nNon-Marketable Securities\\nNon-marketable securities primarily consist of equity securities . We account for non-marketable equity securities \\nthrough which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method.

Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach  as of the transaction date and are \\nrecorded as a component of OI&E.\\nNon-marketable securities that do not have effective contractual maturity dates are classified as other non-\\ncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\nSee Note 3  for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments. \\nAccounts Receivable\\nOur payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the types and locations of our customers and the products or \\nservices offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or \\nservices and customers, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. \\nAdditionally, accounts receivable includes amounts for services performed in advance of the right to invoice the \\ncustomer.\\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts \\nreceivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements \\nof Income. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics \\nexist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In \\ndetermining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due status \\nand make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider \\ncustomer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic \\nconditions.\\nOther\\nOur financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also entered into \\ncommercial arrangements at or near the same time.  For these transactions, judgment is required in assessing the \\nsubstance of the arrangements, including assessing whether the components of the arrangements should be \\naccounted for as separate transactions under the applicable GAAP, and determining the value of the components of \\nthe arrangements, including the fair value of the investments. Additionally, if our investment in such companies \\nbecomes impaired, any remaining performance obligations would be reassessed and may be reduced.\\nImpairment of Investments\\nWe periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment. \\nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is \\nestimated by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past \\nevents, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to OI&E, \\nnot to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in AOCI. If \\nwe have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized \\nloss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will write down the security to its fair value and record the \\ncorresponding charge as a component of OI&E. \\nFor non-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, we consider whether impairment \\nindicators exist by evaluating the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among \\nother indicators. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair \\nvalue by recording the corresponding charge as a component of OI&E. We prepare quantitative measurements of the \\nfair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach.\\nInventory\\nInventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is \\ncomputed using the first-in, first-out method.\\nVariable Interest Entities\\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in \\nwhich we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are \\nthe primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most \\nsignificantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n60.  \"),\n",

If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a \\nVIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination \\nof whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. \\nProperty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets, \\nconstruction in progress, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, offices, \\ndata centers, and related building improvements. Information technology assets include servers and network \\nequipment. Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet \\nbeen placed in service. \\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded using the \\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate. Land is not depreciated. \\nWe depreciate buildings over periods of seven  to 25 years . We depreciate information technology assets generally \\nover a period of six years  for servers and network equipment.  We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter \\nof the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation for buildings, information \\ntechnology assets, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures commences once they are ready for our \\nintended use.\\nGoodwill\\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We \\nevaluate our reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in \\nreporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for \\nimpairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be \\nimpaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.\\nLeases\\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-\\nlease components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily \\ninclude payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease \\npayments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets \\nand liabilities.\\nCertain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the \\nlease assets and liabilities. These amounts  primarily  include  payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, and \\npayments for maintenance and utilities.\\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease \\ncommencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our \\nincremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental \\nborrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, \\nand in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to \\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the \\nbase, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any \\nprepaid lease payments and lease incentives.\\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our \\noperating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is \\nincluded in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease \\nliabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.\\nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease \\nterm.\\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\\nWe review lease s, property and equipment, and intangible assets,  excluding goodwill, for impairment when \\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed \\nat the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by \\ncomparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n61.

If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is \\nmeasured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value. \\nIncome T axes\\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes \\npayable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of \\nevents that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax \\nassets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the likelihood of future realization  of our \\ndeferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets \\nwhen it is more likely than not that they will not be realized or release a valuation allowance to increase deferred tax \\nassets when it is more likely than not that they will be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the \\nglobal intangible low tax Income provision as a current period expense.\\nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on \\ntechnical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the \\nfinancial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be \\nrealized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to \\nunrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.\\nBusiness Combinations\\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the \\npurchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, \\nexcept for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The \\nexcess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. \\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\\nForeign Currency\\nWe translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange \\nrates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for \\nrevenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders’ \\nequity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction \\ncurrency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in OI&E .\\nRecent  Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn November 2023, the Financial Standards Accounting Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update \\n(ASU) 2023-07 \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280):Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\" which expands \\nannual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about \\nsignificant segment expenses.

The primary risk \\nmanaged is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, \\nand investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We \\nalso enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns.\\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives \\nprimarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a \\ncombination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at gross fair values. \\nThe accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\\nCash Flow Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge \\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have \\nmaturities of 24 months  or less.\\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and \\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and \\ntime value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the \\nhedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the \\namount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\\nAs of December 31, 2023 , the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect \\nwas $47 million , which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\\nFair Value Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our \\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the \\nassessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related \\nhedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the \\nexcluded component in OI&E.\\nNet Investment Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks \\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge \\neffectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward \\npoints from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&E.\\nOther Derivatives\\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to \\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the \\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting \\nhedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and \\nliabilities.\\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, \\ncommodity prices, credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns.  From time to time, we enter into derivatives to \\nhedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.

Examples, for which given their \\nnature we cannot estimate a possible loss, include:\\n•In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) \\nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our \\nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the \\nDistrict of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search \\nand Search advertising. The trial ended on November 16, 2023, and we expect a decision in 2024. Further, in \\nJune 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's \\nCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\\n•On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District \\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state \\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology , and a trial is scheduled for March 2025.  Additionally, \\non January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint in \\nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google’s digital advertising technology \\nproducts violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional state Attorneys General \\njoined the complaint. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google's \\nadvertising technology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively. \\nOn June 14, 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its preliminary view that \\nGoogle violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology. We responded to the SO on \\nDecember 1, 2023.\\n•On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for \\nthe Northern District of California, alleging that Google’s operation of Android and Google Pla y violated U.S. \\nantitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement \\nin principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated \\nthe trial date with the states, and any final approval of the settlement is expected to occur in 2024. In May \\n2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play’s business practices.

For example, there are ongoing investigations and \\nlitigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information and \\nadvertising practices, which could result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes. \\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement  lawsuits filed against us claiming that \\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these \\nlawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders \\npreventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change \\nour business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for \\nus and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly \\nbecome an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can \\nresult in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a \\nprohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important \\nproducts into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against \\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, \\nand may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our \\ncustomers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions \\nor otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\\nOther\\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent \\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, \\ncommercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using \\nour platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters.  For example, in December 2023, a California \\njury delivered a verdict in  Epic Games v. Google  finding that Google violated antitrust laws related to Google Play's \\nbusiness. The pr esiding judge will determine remedies in 2024, and the range of potential remedies vary widely. We \\nplan to appeal.  We also periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law.  \\nThese  claims , consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could \\nresult in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our \\nproducts and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other \\nadverse consequences,  all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding \\npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including \\nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect .\\nNon-Income Taxes\\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The \\nsubject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the \\nsale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue \\nnon-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when \\na loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of \\nloss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss.

Stockholders' Equity  \\nClass A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\\nOur Board of Directors has authorized three  classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C \\ncapital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect \\nto voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock \\nis entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law. \\nShares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically \\nconvert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.\\nShare Repurchases\\nIn the years ended December 31, 2021 , 2022 , and 2023 , we repurchased  $50.3 billion , $59.3 billion , and \\n$62.2 billion , respectively, of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares.\\nIn April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional \\n$70.0 billion  of its Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2023 , $36.3 billion  remains available for Class A \\nand Class C share repurchases. \\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Year Ended December 31, 2023\\nShares Amount Shares Amount\\nClass A share repurchases 61$ 6,719 78$ 9,316 \\nClass C share repurchases 469  52,577 450  52,868 \\nTotal share repurchases(1)530 $ 59,296 528 $ 62,184 \\n(1)         Shares repurchased include unsettled repurchases as of December 31, 2023 .\\nClass A and Class C shares are repurchased in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its \\nstockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading \\nprices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. Repurchases are executed from time to time, subject to \\ngeneral business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or \\nprivately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an \\nexpiration date.\\nNote 12.        Net Income Per Share  \\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net \\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net \\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive \\nsecurities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of RSUs and other contingently issuable \\nshares. The dilutive effect of outstanding RSUs and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings \\nper share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A \\nstock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not \\nassume the conversion of those shares.\\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock \\nare identical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of \\nincorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per \\nshare dividends on our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to \\nour certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a \\ngiven class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In \\naddition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it \\nmust be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors.

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services \\nthat have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for \\nthese commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when \\nour customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over \\nthe next 24 months  with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred \\nrevenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with \\nan original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\\nDeferred Revenues\\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, \\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google \\nsubscriptions, platforms, and devices.

Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results \\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements.

Further, \\nin June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's \\nCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\\n•On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District \\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state \\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for March 2025. \\nAdditionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed an \\nantitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google’s digital \\nadvertising technology products violate U.S.  antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional \\nstate Attorneys General joined the complaint.

The EC, the CMA, \\nand the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google's advertising technology business practices \\non June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively.

We responded to the SO on December 1, 2023 .\\n•In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play’s business practices. \\nKorean regulators are investigating Google Play's billing practices, including a formal review in May 2022 of \\nGoogle's compliance with the new app store billing regulations.\\nWe believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vig orously.

Adverse results in \\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or \\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have \\nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss \\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has \\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC \\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important \\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing \\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\\n24\"),\n",

RISK FACTORS     \\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in \\nPart I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 , which \\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of \\nour stock. Below are material changes to our risk factors since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended \\nDecember 31, 2023.\\nRisks Specific to our Company\\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, \\na loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to \\ncustomize ads could harm our business. \\nWe generated more than 75% of total revenues from online advertising in 2023. Many of our advertisers, \\ncompanies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their \\ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more \\nvalue (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more \\neffective monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy \\npractices, such as our initiatives to phase out third-party cookies (which remain subject to review, affecting the \\ntiming), as well as changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, and may \\nin the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that \\nmake customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online \\nservices have integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-\\nparty digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively \\ncould harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse \\nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in \\nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and \\noperating results. \\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock \\nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program or dividend program will be continuously \\nactive or fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases or \\ndividends could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves.\\nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with \\nauthorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date \\nand does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of \\nshares. In April 2024, we announced the approval of a cash dividend to our Class A, Class B and Class C \\nstockholders. Any and all future cash dividends are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors at their sole \\ndiscretion, and in accordance with the requirements of any applicable laws, rules and regulations, including the \\nDelaware General Corporation Law. Our cash dividend program does not require,  and our Board of Directors may \\nnot declare, a cash dividend each quarter, and does not obligate our Board of Directors to declare a dividend in any \\nspecific dollar amount per share. Further, our share repurchases or dividends could affect our share trading prices, \\nincrease their volatility, reduce our cash reserves and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may \\nresult in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.\\nThe trading price for our Class A stock and non-voting Class C stock may continue to be volatile. \\nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile. In \\naddition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading prices of our Class A stock and Class C stock have \\nfluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate widely, in response to various factors, including, among others, the size or \\ncontinuity of either our share repurchase or dividend programs, the activities of our peers and changes in broader \\n43'),\n",

This approval covers both performance stock unit awards and Google stock unit \\nawards, and applies both to currently outstanding and future equity awards. For the avoidance of doubt, the \\ncorresponding amendments to the respective stock unit grant agreements will apply both to currently outstanding \\ngrant agreements and all future grant agreements. As stock units are not outstanding shares of stock and thus \\nwould not otherwise be entitled to participate in any dividends (including the one referenced above), the crediting of \\ndividend equivalent units is intended to preserve the equity-based incentives intended by the Company when the \\nstock units were granted and to treat the holders of stock units consistently with all stockholders.\\n44\"),\n",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  \\nNature of Operations\\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August \\n2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") \\nbecame the successor issuer to Google.\\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that \\nprovide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration \\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received \\nfor subscription-based products.\\nBasis of Consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated \\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  \\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally \\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal \\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of \\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2023 . We have made estimates and assumptions \\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual \\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in \\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form \\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022  filed with the SEC.\\nChange in Accounting Estimate\\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and \\nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years  to six years  and the estimated useful life of certain \\nnetwork equipment from five years  to six years . This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal \\nyear 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and \\nthose placed in service during the six months ended June 30, 2023 , the effect of this change in estimate was a \\nreduction in depreciation expense of $966 million  and $2.0 billion  and an increase in net income of $752 million  and \\n$1.5 billion , or $0.06  and $0.12  per basic and $0.06  and $0.12  per diluted share, for the three and six months ended \\nJune 30, 2023 , respectively. \\nPrior  Period Reclassifications\\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n11'),\n",

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services \\nthat have not yet been recognized as revenue. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these \\ncommitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our \\ncustomers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize \\nsuch as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over t he next 24 \\nmonths  with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue \\ncurrently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, a nd excludes contracts with an original \\nexpected term of one year or less and  cancellable contracts.\\nDeferred Revenues\\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, \\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other . \\nTotal deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022  was $4.5 billion , of which $2.1 billion  was recognized as revenues \\nduring the six months ended June 30, 2023 .Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n12'),\n",

See Note \\n6 for further details on other income (expense), net.\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\nWe use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk \\nmanaged is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, \\nearnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate \\nfluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance \\ninvestment returns.\\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the \\nderivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\\nCash Flow Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge \\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have \\nmaturities of 24 months  or les s.\\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and \\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points \\nand time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life \\nof the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and \\nthe amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\\nAs of June 30, 2023  the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect w as \\n$24 million , which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\\nFair Value Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our \\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in \\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting \\ngains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge \\neffectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net.\\nNet Investment Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks \\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of \\nhedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude \\nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in \\nother income (expense), net.\\nOther Derivatives\\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to \\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the \\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting \\nhedges are primarily recorded in other income (expense), net along with the foreign currency gains and losses on \\nmonetary assets and liabilities.\\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, \\ncommodity prices, credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns.

We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included \\nwithin Other Bets.\\nTotal noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.8 billion  and $3.6 billion  as of \\nDecember 31, 2022  and June 30, 2023 , respectively, of which $1.1 billion  is redeemable noncontrolling interest \\n(RNCI) for both periods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to \\nnoncontrolling interests was not material for an y period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of \\nOI&E. See Note 6  for further details on OI&E.\\nUnconsolidated VIEs\\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private \\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve \\npower generation using renewable sources. \\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that \\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results \\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We \\naccount for these investments as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\\n The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the \\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. We have determined that the single source of our exposure to \\nthese VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated \\nVIEs were $2.7 billion  and $2.8 billion , respectively, as of December 31, 2022  and $3.0 billion  and $3.0 billion , \\nrespectively,  as of June 30, 2023 .\\nNote 5.

The EC decision imposed a \\n€2.4 billion  ($2.7 billion  as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the \\nGeneral Court, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into \\ncompliance with the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion  for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. \\nOn November 10, 2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the \\nEuropean Court of Justice on January 20, 2022.\\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related distribution \\nagreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion  ($5.1 billion  as of June 30, \\n2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, \\nand on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. On September \\n14, 2022, the General Court reduced the fine from €4.3 billion  to €4.1 billion . We subsequently filed an appeal with \\nthe European Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion  for the fine, which we reduced by \\n$217 million  in 2022.\\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that \\nGoogle had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine \\nof €1.5 billion  ($1.7 billion  as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' \\nagreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision, which \\nremains pending. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion  for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition \\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally.  For example:  \\n•In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) \\nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our \\nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the \\nDistrict of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search \\nand Search advertising, and a trial is scheduled for September 2023. Further, in June 2022, the Australian \\nCompetition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's Competition and Markets \\nAuthority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\\n•On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District \\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state \\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. Additionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along \\nwith a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the \\nEastern District of Virginia alleging that Google’s digital advertising technology products violate U.S.  \\nantitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional state Attorneys General joined the complaint. \\nThe EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google's advertising technology \\nbusiness practices on June 22, 2021 , May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively.

We will respond to the SO by December 31, \\n2023.\\n•On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court \\nfor the Northern District of California, alleging that Google’s operation of Android and Google Play violated \\nU.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In May 2022, the EC and the CMA \\neach opened investigations into Google  Play’s business practices. Korean regulators are investigating \\nGoogle Play's billing practices, most recently opening a formal review in May 2022 of Google's compliance \\nwith the new app store billing regulations.\\nWe believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate \\nwith federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that \\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in \\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or \\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have \\nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss \\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has \\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC \\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important \\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing \\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against \\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such \\nclaims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In \\naddition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a \\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\\nOther\\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent \\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and \\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or \\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we currently \\nhave a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. We also periodically have \\ndata incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, lawsuits, regulatory and \\ngovernment investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders could result in substantial fines and penalties, \\ninjunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to \\nour business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of \\nwhich could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding \\npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including \\nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\\nNon-Income Taxes\\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. \\nThe subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied \\nto the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We \\naccrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax \\nauthorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and \\nthe loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss.

Information about Segments and Geographic Areas  \\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\\n•Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps, \\nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales \\nof apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as \\nYouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\\n•Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for \\nenterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform \\nservices, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\\n•Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues \\nfrom Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.  \\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering \\nactivities, and hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the \\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are \\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are \\nallocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue .\\nReflecting DeepMind's  increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, \\nbeginning in the first quarter of 2023 DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs  instead \\nof within Other Bets. Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation \\nmethodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. Prior periods have \\nbeen recast to conform to the current presentation.\\nAs announced on April 20, 2023 , we brought together part of Google Research (the Brain team) and DeepMind \\nto significantly accelerate our progress in artificial intelligence (AI). The group, called Google DeepMind, is reported \\nwithin Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2023. Previously, the \\nBrain team was included within Google Services.\\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs \\nprimarily include  AI-focused shared R&D activities; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; \\ncorporate shared costs such as certain finance , human resource, and legal costs, i ncluding certain fines  and \\nsettlements. Charges associated with reductions in our workforce and office space announced in January 2023 are \\nnot allocated to our segments.

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP \\npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for \\nfinancial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe \\nthe presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to \\nunderstand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of \\nour core operating results.\\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant \\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency \\nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated \\nlevel. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a \\nyear-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior \\nyear comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period \\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are \\ntranslated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of \\nboth periods.\\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with \\nGAAP.

Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and \\nnon-marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.\\nNet cash used in investing activities increased  from the six months ended June 30, 2022  to the six months \\nended June 30, 2023  as a result of an increase in net purchases of and maturities and sales of marketable \\nsecurities, partially offset by a decrease in purchases of property and equipment.\\nCash Used in Financing Activities\\nCash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from \\nthe sale of interest in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of \\nstock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.\\nNet cash used in financing activities increased  from the six months ended June 30, 2022  to the six months \\nended June 30, 2023  primarily due to an increase in repurchases of stock partially offset by a decrease in net \\npayments related to stock-based award activities. \\nLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and \\nfinancing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing \\nand financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future .\\nCapital Expenditures and Leases\\nWe make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets \\nthrough purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our \\nservices and products. \\nCapital Expendi tures\\nOur capital investm ents i n property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:\\n•technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing, \\nstorage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, (collectively referred to \\nas our information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and\\n•office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as \"fit-outs\").\\nConstruction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet \\nbeen placed in service. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend \\nfrom months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with \\nmultiple phases, where we acquire qualified land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install \\ninformation technology assets.\\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2022  and 2023 , we spent $16.6 billion  and $13.2 billion  on capital \\nexpenditures, respectively.  We expect to continue to invest  in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network \\nequipment, and data centers, over the remainder of 2023 and into 2024 to support the growth of our business and \\nour long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI.  Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when \\nthe deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated.  For the \\nsix months ended June 30, 2022  and 2023 , our depreciation and impairment expenses on property and equipment \\nwere $7.3 billion  and $6.3 billion , respectively. \\nLeases\\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2022  and 2023 , we recognized total operating lease assets of $2.2 billion  \\nand $1.7 billion , respectively. As of June 30, 2023 , the amount of total future l ease payments under operating \\nleases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 8.2 years , was $18.2 billion . As of June 30, 2023 , we \\nhave entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $2.9 billion , that are not yet \\nrecorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between  2023  and 2027  with non-\\ncancelable lease terms o f 1 to 34 years.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  \\nNature of Operations\\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in \\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. \\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that \\nprovide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration \\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app \\npurchases, and devices.\\nBasis of Consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated \\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  \\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally \\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal \\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of \\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024 . We have made estimates and assumptions \\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual \\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in \\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form \\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023  filed with the SEC.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update \\n(ASU) 2023-07 \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\" which expands \\nannual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about \\nsignificant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for \\ninterim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the potential \\neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax \\nDisclosures\" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes. Upon adoption  we will be required to disclose \\nstandardized categories in the rate reconciliation in both percentage and dollar  amounts . ASU 2023-09 will also \\nrequire income taxes paid to be disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements.

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services \\nthat have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for \\nthese commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when \\nour customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over \\nthe next 24 months  with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred \\nrevenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with \\nan original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\\nDeferred Revenues\\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due  in advance of our performance, \\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google \\nsubscriptions, platforms, and devices.

We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are \\nincluded within Other Bets.\\nIn July 2024, Alphabet committed to fund up to  $5.0 billion  for the  ongoing operations of Waymo, a fully \\nautonomous driving technology company and a consolidated VIE .\\nTotal noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.4 billion  and $3.3 billion  as of \\nDecember 31, 2023  and June 30, 2024 , respectively, of which $1.1 billion  is redeemable noncontrolling interest \\n(RNCI) for both periods.

Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results \\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We \\naccount for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the \\ninvestments and any future funding commitments.

We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency \\nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated \\nlevel.

Below are \\nmaterial changes to our risk factors since our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 .\\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, \\na loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to \\ncustomize ads could harm our business.\\nWe generated more than 75% of total revenues from online advertising in 2023. Many of our advertisers, \\ncompanies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their \\ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more \\nvalue (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more \\neffective monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy \\npractices, such as our initiatives related to third-party cookies, including our recent announcement to move from \\nphasing out all third-party cookies to a proposed user choice model (which remains subject to continuing \\ndiscussions with regulators), as well as changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices have \\nin the past, and may in the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have \\nbeen developed that make customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, and some \\nproviders of online services have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the availability and \\nfunctionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively \\nand competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse \\nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in \\nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and \\noperating results.\\nITEM 2.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  \\nNature of Operations\\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in \\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. \\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that \\nprovide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration \\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received \\nfor subscription-based products.\\nBasis of Consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated \\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  \\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally \\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal \\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of \\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2023 . We have made estimates and assumptions \\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual \\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in \\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form \\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022  filed with the SEC.\\nChange in Accounting Estimate\\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and \\nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years  to six years  and the estimated useful life of certain \\nnetwork equipment from five years  to six years . This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal \\nyear 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and \\nthose placed in service during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the effect of this change in estimate \\nwas a reduction in depreciation expense of $977 million  and $2.9 billion  and an increase in net income of $761 \\nmillion  and $2.3 billion , or $0.06  and $0.18  per basic and $0.06  and $0.18  per diluted share, for the three and nine \\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. \\nPrior Period Reclassifications\\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n11'),\n",

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future \\nservices that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these \\ncommitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our \\ncustomers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize \\nsuch as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over t he next 24 \\nmonths  with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenu e \\ncurrently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original \\nexpected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\\nDeferred Revenues\\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, \\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other . \\nTotal deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022  was $4.5 billion , of which $2.3 billion  was recognized as revenues \\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2023 .Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n12'),\n",

Our share of gains and losses, including \\nimpairments, are included as a component of OI&E, in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  See Note 6  for \\nfurther details on OI&E.\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\nWe use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk \\nmanaged is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, \\nearnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate \\nfluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance \\ninvestment returns.\\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the \\nderivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy \\ncomprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at \\ngross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\\nCash Flow Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge \\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have \\nmaturities of 24 months  or les s.\\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and \\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points \\nand time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life \\nof the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and \\nthe amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\\nAs of September 30, 2023 , the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax \\neffect w as $691 million , which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\\nFair Value Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our \\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in \\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the \\nrelated hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize \\nchanges in the excluded component in OI&E.\\nNet Investment Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks \\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of \\nhedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude \\nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in \\nOI&E.\\nOther Derivatives\\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to \\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the \\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting \\nhedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and \\nliabilities.\\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, \\ncommodity prices, credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns.  From time to time, we enter into derivatives \\nto hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.

Variable Interest Entities (VIE)\\nConsolidated VIEs\\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of \\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. \\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to \\nus. As of December 31, 2022  and September 30, 2023 , assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these \\nVIEs were $4.1 billion  and $2.6 billion , respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the \\nVIEs were $2.6 billion  and $2.2 billion , respectively.  We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs \\nthat are included within Other Bets.\\nTotal noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.8 billion  and $3.4 billion  as of \\nDecember 31, 2022  and September 30, 2023 , respectively, of which $1.1 billion  is redeemable noncontrolling \\ninterest (RNCI) for both periods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to \\nnoncontrolling interests was not material for an y period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of \\nOI&E. See Note 6  for further details on OI&E.\\nUnconsolidated VIEs\\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private \\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve \\npower generation using renewable sources. \\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that \\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results \\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We \\naccount for these investments primarily  as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\\n The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the \\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. The maximum exposure and carrying value of these \\nunconsolidated VIEs were $2.8 billion  and $2.7 billion , respectively, as of December 31, 2022  and $5.5 billion  and \\n$3.8 billion , respectively, as of September 30, 2023 . The difference between the maximum exposure and the \\ncarrying value relates primarily to future funding commitments.\\nNote 5.    Debt\\nShort-Term Debt\\nWe have a debt financing program of up to  $10.0 billion  through the issuance of commercial paper. Net \\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes.

On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the \\nGeneral Court, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into \\ncompliance with the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion  for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. \\nOn November 10, 2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the \\nEuropean Court of Justice on January 20, 2022.\\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related distribution \\nagreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion  ($5.1 billion  as of June 30, \\n2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, \\nand on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. On September \\n14, 2022, the General Court reduced the fine from €4.3 billion  to €4.1 billion . We subsequently filed an appeal with \\nthe European Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion  for the fine, which we reduced by \\n$217 million  in 2022.\\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that \\nGoogle had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine \\nof €1.5 billion  ($1.7 billion  as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' \\nagreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision. We \\nrecognized a charge of $1.7 billion  for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition \\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. For example: \\n•In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) \\nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our \\nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the \\nDistrict of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search \\nand Search advertising. The trial commenced on September 12, 2023, and we expect a decision  in 2024. \\nFurther, in June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United \\nKingdom's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution \\npractices.\\n•On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District \\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state \\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. Additionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along \\nwith a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the \\nEastern District of Virginia alleging that Google’s digital advertising technology products violate U.S.  \\nantitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional state Attorneys General joined the complaint . \\nThe EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google's advertising technology Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n27\"),\n",

In September 2023, we reached a \\nsettlement in principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court \\nsubsequently vacated the trial date with the states, and any final approval of the settlement is expected to \\noccur in 2024. In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play’s business \\npractices. Korean regulators are investigating Google Play's billing practices, including a formal review in \\nMay 2022 of Google's compliance with the new app store billing regulations. On O ctober 6, 2023, the Korea  \\nCommunications Commission issued a preliminary decision that we are not in full compliance with the new \\nregulations. We intend to respond in November 2023.\\nWe believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vig orously.  We continue to cooperate \\nwith federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that \\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in \\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or \\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have \\nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss \\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has \\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC \\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important \\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing \\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against \\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such \\nclaims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In \\naddition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a \\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\\nOther\\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent \\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and \\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or \\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we currently \\nhave a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. We also periodically have \\ndata incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, lawsuits, regulatory and \\ngovernment investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders could result in substantial fines and penalties, \\ninjunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to \\nour business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of \\nwhich could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding \\npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including \\nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\\nNon-Income Taxes\\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. \\nThe subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied \\nto the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We \\naccrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax \\nauthorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.

Information about Segments and Geographic Areas  \\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\\n•Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps, \\nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales \\nof apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as \\nYouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\\n•Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for \\nenterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform \\nservices, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\\n•Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues \\nfrom Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.  \\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering \\nactivities, and hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the \\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are \\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are \\nallocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\\nReflecting DeepMind's increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, \\nbeginning in the first quarter of 2023 DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs instead \\nof within Other Bets. Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation \\nmethodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. Prior periods have \\nbeen recast to conform to the current presentation.\\nAs announced on April 20, 2023, we brought together part of Google Research (the Brain team) and DeepMind \\nto significantly accelerate our progress in artificial intelligence (AI). The group, called Google DeepMind, is reported \\nwithin Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2023. Previously, the \\nBrain team was included within Google Services.\\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs \\nprimarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; \\ncorporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and \\nsettlements. Charges associated with reductions in our workforce and office space announced in January 2023 are \\nnot allocated to our segments.

We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency \\nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated \\nlevel. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a \\nyear-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior \\nyear comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period \\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are \\ntranslated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of \\nboth periods.\\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with \\nGAAP.

The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend \\nfrom months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with \\nmultiple phases, where we acquire qualified land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install \\ninformation technology assets.\\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2022  and 2023 , we spent $23.9 billion  and $21.2 billion  on \\ncapital expenditures, respectively.

Depreciation of our property and equipment \\ncommences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not \\ndepreciated.

(February 8, 2024) – Alphabet Inc.

TRC Capital Investment’s offer price of $138.90 per share is \\napproximately 4.48 percent lower than the $145.41 closing share price of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock \\non February 6, 2024 – the business day prior to the date of the offer. This offer to purchase up to 1 million \\nshares by TRC Capital Investment represents less than 0.02 percent of the shares of Alphabet’s Class C \\ncapital stock outstanding as of the February 7, 2024 offer date.\\nAlphabet does not endorse TRC Capital Investment’s unsolicited mini-tender offer and recommends that \\nstockholders do not tender their shares in response to TRC Capital Investment’s offer because the offer is \\nat a price below the current market price for Alphabet’s Class C shares and subject to numerous \\nconditions. Alphabet is not affiliated or associated in any way with TRC Capital Investment, its mini-tender \\noffer or its offer documentation.\\nTRC Capital Investment’s has made many similar mini-tender offers for shares of other companies. Mini-\\ntender offers seek to acquire less than 5 percent of a company’s shares outstanding, thereby avoiding \\nmany disclosure and procedural requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \\nthat apply to offers for more than 5 percent of a company’s shares outstanding. As a result, mini-tender \\noffers do not provide investors with the same level of protections as provided for larger tender offers \\nunder U.S. securities laws.\\nThe SEC has cautioned investors that some bidders making mini-tender offers at below-market prices are \\n“hoping that they will catch investors off guard if the investors do not compare the offer price to the current \\nmarket price.” More on the SEC’s guidance to investors on mini-tender offers is available at www.sec.gov/\\ninvestor/pubs/minitend.htm .\\nAlphabet urges investors to obtain current market quotations for their shares, to consult with their broker \\nor financial advisor and to exercise caution with respect to TRC Capital Investment’s offer. Alphabet \\nrecommends that stockholders who have not responded to TRC Capital Investment’s offer take no action. \\nStockholders who have already tendered their shares may withdraw them at any time prior to the \\nexpiration of the offer, in accordance with TRC Capital Investment’s offer documentation. The offer is \\ncurrently scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m., New York City time, on March 8, 2024. TRC Capital \\nInvestment may extend the offering period at its discretion.\\nAlphabet encourages brokers and dealers, as well as other market participants, to review the SEC’s letter \\nregarding broker-dealer mini-tender offer dissemination and disclosure at www.sec.gov/divisions/\\nmarketreg/minitenders/sia072401.htm .\\nAlphabet requests that a copy of this release be included with all distributions relating to TRC Capital \\nInvestment’s mini-tender offer related to shares of Alphabet stock.'),\n",

(NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) today announced financial \\nresults for the quarter ended  March 31, 2023 .\\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google, said: “We are pleased with our business performance in the first \\nquarter, with Search performing well and momentum in Cloud. We introduced important product updates anchored \\nin deep computer science and AI. Our North Star is providing the most helpful answers for our users, and we see \\nhuge opportunities ahead, continuing our long track record of innovation.”\\nRuth Porat, CFO of Alphabet and Google, said: “Resilience in Search and momentum in Cloud resulted in Q1 \\nconsolidated revenues of $69.8 billion, up 3% year over year, or up 6% in constant currency. We remain committed \\nto delivering long-term growth and creating capacity to invest in our most compelling growth areas by re-engineering \\nour cost base.”\\nQ1 2023  financial highlights  (unaudited)\\nOur first quarter  2023 results reflect:\\ni.$2.6 billion  in charges related to reductions in our workforce and office space; \\nii.a $988 million  reduction in depreciation expense from the change in estimated useful life of our servers and \\ncertain network equipment; and\\niii.a shift in the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards resulting in relatively less  \\nstock-based compensation expense recognized in the first quarter compared to the remaining quarters of \\nthe ye ar.

In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space, and as a result we \\nrecorded charges related to office space reductions of $564 million in the first quarter of 2023. We may incur \\nadditional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs.\\nThese severance and office space charges are included within our consolidated statements of income for the three \\nmonths ended March 31, 2023  as follows (in millions):\\nSeverance and \\nRelated Office Space Total\\nCost of revenues $ 461 $ 220 $ 681 \\nResearch and development  835  247  1,082 \\nSales and marketing  445  35  480 \\nGeneral and administrative  253  62  315 \\nTotal charges $ 1,994 $ 564 $ 2,558 \\nFor segment reporting, the substantial majority of these charges are included withi n unallocated corporate costs in \\nour segment results.\\nChange in Useful Lives of Our Server and Network Equipment\\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and \\nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years  to six years  and the estimated useful life of certain \\nnetwork equipment from five years  to six years . This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal \\nyear 2023 and the effect for the three months ended March 31, 2023  was a reduction in depreciation expense of \\n$988 million  and an increase in net income of $770 million , or $0.06  per basic and $0.06  per diluted share .\\nTiming of Our Annual Employee Equity Grants\\nBeginning in 2023, the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards shifted from January to \\nMarch. While the shift in timing itself will not affect the amount of stock-based compensation expense over the full \\nfiscal year 2023, it results in relatively less expense recognized in the first quarter compared to the remaining \\nquarters of the year.\\nStock Repurchases\\nOn April 19, 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional \\n$70.0 billion  of its Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its \\nstockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading \\nprices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares.

We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful \\nsupplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be \\nindicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign \\nexchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that \\nboth management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our \\nperformance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures \\nalso facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons \\nto our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both \\nbecause (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and \\noperational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help \\nthem analyze the health of our business.\\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these \\nlimitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial \\nmeasures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in \\naccordance with GAAP.\\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned “Reconciliation from \\nnet cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow” and “Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP \\nconstant currency revenues and GAAP percentage change in revenues to non-GAAP percentage change in \\nconstant currency revenues” included at the end of this release.\\nContact\\nInvestor relations Media\\ninvestor-relations@abc.xyz press@abc.xyz\\n4'),\n",

Years ago, when I was studying in the U.S., my dad – \\nwho was back in India – got his first email address. \\nI was really excited to have a faster (and cheaper) \\nway to communicate with him, so I sent a message.\\nAnd then I waited … and waited. It was two full days \\nbefore I got this reply:\\n“Dear Mr. Pichai, email received. All is well.”\\nPerplexed by the delay and the formality, I called him \\nup to see what happened. He told me that someone \\nat his work had to bring up the email on their office \\ncomputer, print it out, and then deliver it to him. \\nMy dad dictated a response, which the guy wrote \\ndown and eventually typed up to send back to me.\\nFast-forward to a few months ago: I was with my \\nteenage son. He saw something interesting, took \\nsome quick pictures, and shared them with his friends. \\nThen they exchanged a few messages, and it all \\nseemed faster than the time it would take me just \\nto pull out my phone.\\nHow I communicated with my dad all those years ago \\ncompared with how my son communicates today \\nshows just how much change can happen across \\ngenerations. Technology that takes us years to \\nadapt to is second nature for our kids. Ideas my dad \\nmarveled at as science fiction – taking a call from your \\nwatch or telling your car to play your favorite song – \\nmake my children shrug.\\nThose shrugs give me great hope for the future. \\nThey set a high bar for what the next generation will \\nbuild and invent ... and I can’t wait to see what will make their children shrug, too.\\nAn essential truth of innovation is that the moment \\nyou push the boundary of a technology, it soon goes \\nfrom extraordinary to ordinary. That’s why Google has \\nnever taken our success for granted.[Letter originally published September 2023]  \\nThis month, Google will celebrate our 25th birthday. \\nIt’s a huge privilege to reach this milestone, made \\npossible by the people who use our products and \\nchallenge us to keep innovating, the hundreds of \\nthousands of Googlers past and present who have \\ngiven their talents to building those products, and our \\npartners, who believe in our mission as much as we do.\\n→\\nAnnualReport2023_Letter_0418.indd   1AnnualReport2023_Letter_0418.indd   1 4/18/24   1:22 PM4/18/24   1:22 PM'),\n",

The product they built, \\nGoogle Search, went on to help billions of people \\naround the world get answers to their questions.\\nFor a few years, I was one of those people experiencing \\nGoogle like any other user of the web. I remember \\nfeeling blown away by Google’s ability to find the best \\nanswer for the most esoteric questions, from a tiny \\ndetail buried in a store’s customer service page to an \\nobscure football rule.\\nThe questions I’ve asked Google have evolved over \\ntime: “How do you fix a dripping faucet?” “Fastest \\nroute to Stanford Hospital?” “Ways to calm a crying baby?” And right around spring of 2003, perhaps: \\n“How to ace a Google interview?” And over time, \\nGoogle got much better at answering them.\\nIt’s been inspiring to see what people have done with \\nthe answers to their questions, be it to find health care \\nor comfort in difficult times, learn new skills, pursue \\nnew career paths, or start new businesses. The idea \\nthat a student in rural Indonesia could access the \\nsame information as a professor at Stanford was \\nrevolutionary and has changed lives and our world \\nfor the better. It’s opened up access to education and \\nentrepreneurship like nothing else before it or since.\\nSearch also laid the foundations for Google to make \\nan economic impact beyond our own walls. Our advertising platforms and tools started out with a \\npremise as simple as Search itself: to help businesses reach customers who were already looking for the kinds of products and services they offer. It was \\na platform that appealed to small businesses in \\nparticular, like the mail-order business selling lobsters \\nthat was the first to sign up. And also like Search itself, the ability for any business to advertise online has had \\na truly transformational impact, helping millions of \\nbusinesses become part of the digital economy.A quarter century \\nof questions\\nSearch is still at the core of our mission, and it’s still \\nour biggest moonshot with so much more to do.\\nOf course, Google today is more than a search box. \\nWe have 15 Google products that each serve more \\nthan half a billion people and businesses, and six that \\nserve more than 2 billion users each.\\nLike most Google searches, all those products started with a question, too. With Gmail it was: Could we offer \\n1 GB of storage to every person? In 2004, when Gmail \\nlaunched, that volume of storage was over 100X what \\nmost other free webmail services were offering!\\nThen a few years later, we saw an opportunity to \\ndramatically improve web browsers – and in turn \\nthe web – for people everywhere. So with Chrome \\nwe asked: Could we build a browser that made the web better, with simplicity, speed, and security at its \\ncore? Right before launch, I had my own question: \\nWill people use this?\\nYouTube dared to ask: What if we gave everyone \\na way to share what they know with the world? \\nAnd today, it’s become a powerful platform for \\nlearning and knowledge.\\nThe questions have kept coming, and we’ve kept \\nimproving and expanding our products with new \\nanswers: What if Google Maps enabled people to \\nsee every street in the world in detail? What if we \\nbuilt a translation tool that allowed people to access \\ninformation and communicate in multiple languages? \\nWhat if you could search and find all your old photos \\nby simply describing what you wanted to see?\\nWe’ve also asked ourselves how we could best share \\nour tools, breakthroughs, and infrastructure with others. Google was built in the cloud from the start, even though we only launched our Cloud business \\nin 2008. Today, Google Cloud has become one of \\nthe top enterprise companies in the world. Partners \\nacross industries are using Google technology to \\nimprove customer support and supply chain efficiency, \\nreduce their carbon footprint, build new applications, \\nand get more done with AI. Like our advertising clients \\nbefore them, Cloud’s partners are operating better, \\ngrowing faster, and creating jobs with our help.\\nAnnualReport2023_Letter_0418.indd   2AnnualReport2023_Letter_0418.indd   2 4/18/24   1:22 PM4/18/24   1:22 PM'),\n",

In any 25-year journey, you take a \\nfew lumps, learn the lessons, and work to do better. \\nRemember Google Wave?\\nWe’ve also faced hard questions about our future as \\na company. In the 2000s, it was: How long can the \\nweb really last? In the 2010s, people asked if we could adapt to the era of mobile computing and whether \\nsearch was “over”? Each time, we’ve answered by \\ncoming back even stronger. We’ve done this guided by \\na singular focus on our mission, our belief in applying \\ndeep computer science to make people’s lives better, \\nand a healthy disregard for the impossible.\\nA healthy disregard \\nfor the impossible\\nThat healthy disregard is why we’ve been able to take \\non problems others couldn’t – or wouldn’t. There was, \\nfor example, this impossible idea of putting a powerful \\ncomputer in everyone’s pocket, no matter their \\nincome or internet connectivity. Today, Android runs \\non 3 billion devices all over the world, from the latest \\nfoldables to entry-level phones. It’s been at the core \\nof our efforts to make the internet more accessible for everyone and inspired other transformative products. \\nLikewise, Chromebooks made computing available \\nto schools all over the world. And Google Pixel puts the best of our latest technology – machine learning-\\npowered cameras, speech recognition, transcription \\ncapabilities, tensor chips, and more – directly into \\npeople’s hands.\\nWhich brings us to AI. Google has been investing \\nin AI since almost the beginning. We were one of \\nthe first to use machine learning in our products, \\nstarting in the early 2000s, for spelling corrections, \\nimproving the quality of ads, and showing \\nsuggestions and recommendations.\\nThen, in the early 2010s, there was real excitement \\naround deep neural networks. In 2012, a few of us \\nwent along to a demo in a meeting room near Charlie’s, \\nour main campus café. I remember watching in awe \\nas the Research team showed us the progress they’d \\nmade with image recognition, driven by breakthroughs \\nin neural networks. It was the first moment I thought \\nto myself: This is really going to change everything!I had a similar feeling when I saw the groundbreaking, \\ninterdisciplinary research happening at DeepMind, \\nfocused on understanding the nature of intelligence. \\nThis progress deeply influenced my thinking, when \\nI became CEO in 2015, that Google should pivot to \\nbe an AI-first company.\\nMore questions followed. How to power this new \\ngeneration of computing? So we invented Tensor \\nProcessing Units, or TPUs – which provided dramatic \\nperformance improvements of 30X to 80X for machine learning over other hardware at the time, \\nand powered the AlphaGo computer, which beat the \\nGo world champion Lee Sedol in 2016. Around the \\nsame time, we released our landmark Transformer \\npaper in 2017, which created the neural network \\narchitecture that’s the foundation for most of the \\ngenerative AI and large language models today.\\nMany of these technology breakthroughs have led \\nto some of our most incredible product innovations. \\nSearch results for complex queries got much more \\nhelpful because of large language models like MUM \\nand BERT. We’ve created entirely new ways for people \\nto express what they’re looking for through voice, \\nimages, and even asking questions about what they \\nsee with multisearch. Now generative AI is helping us \\nreimagine our core products in exciting ways – from \\nour new Search Generative Experience (SGE) to “Help \\nMe Write” in Gmail. And earlier this year, we launched Bard, an early experiment that lets people collaborate with generative AI.\\nMy favorite moments are seeing how our products \\ncan make a difference in people’s lives: Whether it’s \\na busy parent taking a photo of their craft drawer and \\nusing Bard to inspire a rainy day project for their kids; \\na traveler using Lens to translate a train schedule in \\na foreign country; or, more profoundly, a family able \\nto hear the voice of a man with ALS, thanks to our \\nresearch on speech recognition and synthesis.\\nDesigning products that help people at scale is both a privilege and a responsibility. People have their own \\nquestions: Can we trust these new technologies? \\nWe think deeply about how to build responsible \\ntechnology from the start, whether it’s making sure \\neveryone’s information is protected and secure, or keeping people safe from bad actors online. →\\nAnnualReport2023_Letter_0418.indd   3AnnualReport2023_Letter_0418.indd   3 4/18/24   1:22 PM4/18/24   1:22 PM'),\n",

Our development and use of AI must address \\nthese risks, and help to develop the technology \\nresponsibly. The AI principles we launched in 2018 \\nare an important part of how we do this. These \\nprinciples prompt questions like: Will it be helpful to people and benefit society, or could it lead to harm in \\nany way? They also shape our product development and AI applications, and guide us in finding solutions \\nto emerging issues. For example, just last week we \\nintroduced SynthID, a tool for watermarking and identifying AI-generated images, which will help \\naddress an important issue around transparency. \\nWe’ll continue to engage with experts and the \\ncommunity to keep learning and improving.\\nLooking ahead\\nAs we look ahead, I’ve been reflecting on the \\ncommitment from our original founders’ letter in 2004: \\n“to develop services that improve the lives of as many \\npeople as possible – to do things that matter.”\\nWith AI, we have the opportunity to do things that \\nmatter on an even larger scale.\\nWe’re just beginning to see what the next wave \\nof technology is capable of and how quickly it can \\nimprove. One million people are already using \\ngenerative AI in Google Workspace to write and create. Flood forecasting now covers places where \\n460+ million people live. A million researchers have \\nused the AlphaFold database, which covers 200 \\nmillion predictions of protein structures, helping with \\nadvances to cut plastic pollution, tackle antibiotic \\nresistance, fight malaria, and more. And we’ve \\ndemonstrated how AI can help the airline industry \\nto decrease contrails from planes, an important tool \\nfor fighting climate change.\\nStill, there is so much more ahead. Over time, AI will be \\nthe biggest technological shift we see in our lifetimes. \\nIt’s bigger than the shift from desktop computing to \\nmobile, and it may be bigger than the internet itself. \\nIt’s a fundamental rewiring of technology and an \\nincredible accelerant of human ingenuity.\\nAnnualReport2023_Letter_0418.indd   4AnnualReport2023_Letter_0418.indd   4 4/18/24   1:22 PM4/18/24   1:22 PM'),\n",

We do not \\nintend to become one.” That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history, inspiring us to tackle big \\nproblems and invest in moonshots. It led us to be a pioneer in the development of AI and, since 2016, an AI-first company. \\nWe continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO, Sundar Pichai.\\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google \\nServices and Google Cloud, and all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Alphabet’s structure is about helping \\neach of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence. \\nAccess\\tand\\t Technology for\\tEveryone\\nThe Internet is one of the world’s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people, and businesses large and small. Our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it was when we were \\nfounded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that also helps \\npeople get things done. \\nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools they need \\nto increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information and make sense \\nof the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year. YouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new. Google Assistant offers the best way to get things done \\nseamlessly across different devices, providing intelligent help throughout a person’s day, no matter where they are. Google Cloud \\nhelps customers solve today’s business challenges, improve productivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines. We are continually innovating and building new products and features that will help our users, partners, customers, and communities \\nand have invested more than $150 billion in research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts.\\nMakingAI\\tHelpful for\\tEveryone\\nAI is a transformational technology that can bring meaningful and positive change to people and societies across the world, \\nand for our business. At Google, we have been bringing AI into our products and services for more than a decade and \\nmaking them available to our users. Our journey began in 2001, when machine learning was first incorporated into Google \\nSearch to suggest better spellings to users searching the web. Today, AI in our products is used by billions of people globally through features like autocomplete suggestions in Google Search; translation across 133 languages in Google \\nTranslate; and organization, searching, and editing in Google Photos.\\nLarge language models (LLMs) are an exciting aspect of our work in AI based on deep learning architectures, such as the \\nTransformer, a neural network architecture that we introduced in 2017 that helped with language understanding. This led to \\nthe Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, or BERT, in 2019 that helped Search understand the intent of \\nuser search queries better than ever before.\\nGoogle was a company built in the cloud, and we continue to invest in our Google Cloud offerings, including Google \\nCloud Platform and Google Workspace, to help organizations stay at the forefront of AI innovation with our AI-optimized \\ninfrastructure, mature AI platform and world-class models, and assistive agents.\\nWe believe AI can solve some of the hardest societal, scientific and engineering challenges of our time. For example, in 2020, \\nGoogle DeepMind’s AlphaFold system solved a 50-year-old protein folding challenge. Since then, we have open-sourced to \\nthe scientific community 200 million of AlphaFold’s protein structures which are used to work on everything from accelerating \\nnew malaria vaccines to advancing cancer drug discovery and developing plastic-eating enzymes. As another example, AI can also have a transformative effect on climate progress by providing helpful information, predicting climate-related events, \\nand optimizing climate action. Using advanced AI and geospatial analysis, Google Research has developed flood forecasting \\nmodels that can provide early warning and real-time flooding information to communities and individuals. \\n1 Alphabet  2023 Annual Report'),\n",

With a bold and responsible \\napproach, we continue to take the next steps to make this technology even more helpful for everyone.\\nDeliver\\tthe\\tMost\\t Advanced, Safe,\\tand\\tResponsible AI\\nWe aim to build the most advanced, safe, and responsible AI with models that are developed, trained, and rigorously tested \\nat scale powered by our continued investment in AI technical infrastructure. In December 2023, we launched Gemini, our \\nmost capable and general model. It was built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means it can generalize and \\nseamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information, including text, code, audio, images, and video. Our teams across Alphabet will leverage Gemini, as well as other AI models we have previously developed and \\nannounced, across our business to deliver the best product and service experiences for our users, advertisers, partners, \\ncustomers, and developers.\\nWe believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. That means developing AI in a way that maximizes the \\npositive benefits to society while addressing the challenges, guided by our AI Principles. We published these in 2018, as one \\nof the first companies to articulate principles that put beneficial use, users, safety, and avoidance of harms above business considerations. While there is natural tension between being bold and being responsible, we believe it is possible — and in \\nfact critical — to embrace that tension productively.\\nEnable\\tOrganizations\\tand\\tDevelopers\\tto\\tInnovate\\ton\\t GoogleCloud\\nAI is not only a powerful enabler, it is also a major platform shift. Globally, businesses from startups to large enterprises, \\nand the public sector are thinking about how to drive transformation. That is why we are focused on making it easy and \\nscalable for others to innovate, and grow, with AI. That means providing the most advanced computing infrastructure and \\nexpanding access to Google’s latest AI models that have been rigorously tested in our own products. Our Vertex AI platform gives developers the ability to train, tune, augment, and deploy applications using generative AI models and services such \\nas Enterprise Search and Conversations. Duet AI for Google Cloud provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers \\nto write, test, document, and operate software.\\nImprove\\tKnowledge,\\tLearning,\\t Creativity,\\tand\\tProductivity\\nThings that we now consider routine – like spell check, mobile check deposit, or Google Search, Google Translate, and Google Maps – all use AI. As AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on giving helpful features to our users as we \\ncontinue to deliver on our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.\\nWhile we have been integrating AI into our products for years, we are now embedding the power of generative AI to \\ncontinue helping our users express themselves and get things done. For example, Duet AI in Google Workspace helps \\nusers write, organize, visualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings. Bard allows users to collaborate with \\nexperimental AI with new features that include image capabilities, coding support, and app integration. Dream Screen, a new experimental feature in YouTube, allows for the creation of AI-generated video or image backgrounds to Shorts by \\ntyping an idea into a prompt.\\nWe also know businesses of all sizes around the world rely on Google Ads to find customers and grow their businesses — \\nand we make that even easier with AI. With Performance Max, advertisers simply tell us their campaign goals and share their creative assets, and AI will automatically produce and run a highly effective ad campaign across all of Google’s \\nproperties, to meet their budget. Product Studio brings the benefits of AI to businesses of all sizes, helping them easily \\ncreate uniquely-tailored imagery featuring their products — for free. Additionally, we are experimenting with Search and Shopping ads that are directly integrated into the AI-powered snapshot and conversational mode in Search Generative \\nExperience.\\nBuildtheMost\\tHelpful\\tPersonal\\t Computing\\tPlatforms\\tand\\tDevices\\nOver the years, our Pixel phones have incorporated AI compute directly into the device and built experiences on top of it. \\nOur latest Pixel devices were built around AI, bringing the best AI-assistive experiences to our users, such as Best Take, \\nMagic Editor, and Audio Magic Eraser. As we look ahead, we are designing our Android and Chrome operating systems with \\nnew AI-forward user experiences. \\n2 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV'),\n",

This incrementalism \\nleads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People \\nthought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome, but those efforts have \\nmatured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. Our early investments in AI started out as moonshots but are now incorporated into our core products and central to future developments. We continue \\nto look toward the future and to invest for the long term, most notably for the application of AI to our products and services, \\nas well as other frontier technologies such as quantum computing. As we said in the original founders’ letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in, as they are the key to our long-term success.\\nPrivacy\\tand Security\\nWe make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are near-term financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default; strictly \\nupholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that put people \\nin control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete their data, giving them tools, such as My Ad Center, to control their ad experience, or advancing anti-malware, anti-phishing, and password \\nsecurity features.\\nGoogle\\nFor reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\\nGoogle\\tServices\\nServing Our\\tUsers\\nWe have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people worldwide. \\nOur product innovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. \\nGoogle Services’ core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, \\nGoogle Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing adoption by users around the world.\\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than 25 years ago. While Google \\nSearch started as a way to find web pages, organized into ten blue links, we have driven technical advancements and \\nproduct innovations that have transformed Google Search into a dynamic, multimodal experience. We first expanded from traditional desktop browsers into mobile web search, making it easier to navigate on smaller screens. As new \\ntypes of content surfaced on the internet, Universal Search made it possible to search multiple content types, like news, \\nimages, videos, and more, to deliver rich, relevant results. The introduction of new search modalities, like voice and visual search, made it easier for people to express their curiosity in natural and intuitive ways. We took that a step further with \\nmultisearch, which lets people search with text and images at the same time. Large language models like BERT and \\nMultitask Unified Models, or MUMs, have made it possible to express more natural language queries, vastly improving the quality of results. Each advancement has made it easier and more natural for people to find what they are looking for.\\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery and creation \\nof digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. People are consuming many forms \\nof digital content, including watching videos, streaming TV, playing games, listening to music, reading books, and using apps. Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people around the world to create and \\nfind great digital content.\\nFueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and devices. That is why we continue to invest in \\nplatforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, and Chrome operating system, as well as growing \\nour family of devices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make people’s lives easier by combining \\nthe best of our AI, software, and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of devices, such as the new Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, and the Pixel Watch 2. Creating products and services that people rely on every day is a journey that \\nwe are investing in for the long-term.\\n3 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV'),\n",

However, because of differences in the availability of renewable energy sources like solar and wind across the regions where we operate—and because of the variable supply of these resources—we still need to rely on carbon-emitting \\nenergy sources that power local grids. That is why we set a goal to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) on every grid \\nwhere we operate by 2030.\\nAchieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals. We also know that our path to net-zero \\nemissions will not be easy or linear. Some of our plans may take years to deliver results, particularly where they involve building new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. So as our business continues to evolve, we expect our \\nemissions to rise before dropping towards our absolute emissions reduction target.\\nTo benefit the people and places where we operate, we have set goals to replenish 120% of the freshwater volume we \\nconsume, on average, across our offices and data centers by 2030 and to help restore and improve the quality of water and health of ecosystems in the communities where we operate. \\nWe also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains. Our circularity \\nprinciples focus on designing out waste from the start, keeping materials in use for as long as possible, and promoting healthy materials—for our data centers, workplaces, and products.\\nMore information on our approach to sustainability can be found in our annual sustainability reports, including Google’s \\nEnvironmental Report.

Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, such as our initiatives to phase out \\nthird-party cookies, as well as changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, \\nand may in the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online services \\nhave integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital \\nadvertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic \\nconditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in fluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. \\nWeface\\tintense\\tcompetition.\\tIf\\twe\\tdo\\tnot\\tcontinue\\tto\\tinnovate\\tand\\tprovide\\tproducts\\tand\\tservices\\tthat\\t\\nare\\tuseful\\tto users,customers, andotherpartners, wemaynotremaincompetitive, whichcouldharmour\\nbusiness,\\t financial\\tcondition,\\tand\\toperating\\tresults.\\t\\nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, we must accurately \\nanticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies in a \\ntimely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in technical infrastructure and R&D, including through \\nacquisitions, in order to enhance our technology, products, and services. \\nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range \\nfrom large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer operating histories and \\nwell-established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our \\ncompetitive position, including by making acquisitions and entering into other strategic arrangements; continuing to invest heavily in technical infrastructure, R&D, and in talent; initiating intellectual property and competition claims (whether or not \\nmeritorious); and continuing to compete for users, advertisers, customers, and content providers. Further, discrepancies \\nin enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to aggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive advantages. Our competitors may also be able to innovate and \\nprovide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before we do. \\nWe are expanding our investment in AI across the entire company. This includes generative AI and continuing to integrate AI \\ncapabilities into our products and services. AI technology and services are highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and require significant investment, including development and operational costs, to meet the changing needs and expectations of our \\nexisting users and attract new users. Our ability to deploy certain AI technologies critical for our products and services and \\nfor our business strategy may depend on the availability and pricing of third-party equipment and technical infrastructure. Additionally, other companies may develop AI products and technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies or \\nmore cost-effective to deploy. Other companies may also have (or in the future may obtain) patents or other proprietary \\nrights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, or sell our own AI products and services.\\n8 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV'),\n",

There can be no assurance we will be able to provide devices that compete effectively. \\nWithin Google Cloud, we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services, including \\nGoogle Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, and we are advancing our AI platforms and models to support these tools \\nand technologies. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services, invest \\nin cybersecurity, and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our sales force. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models are competitive and constantly \\nevolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objectives. Further, our business \\nwith public sector customers may present additional risks, including regulatory compliance risks. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and cost reviews, and any failure to comply or any deficiencies found may expose us to legal, \\nfinancial, and/or reputational risks. Evolving laws and regulations may require us to make new capital investments, build \\nnew products, and seek partners to deliver localized services in other countries, and we may not be able to meet sovereign operating requirements. \\nWithin Other Bets, we are investing significantly in the areas of health, life sciences, and transportation, among others. \\nThese investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors, and our offerings, \\nmany of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies, may not be successful, or be able to compete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability. \\nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI, raise ethical, technological, legal, \\nregulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services.

In particular, margins on our devices have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our consolidated margins \\ndue to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales. We may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins \\nfrom increasing regulations, increasing competition, and increasing costs for many aspects of our business.

For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect \\nour proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, \\nit is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have adequate patent or \\ncopyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable. \\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and other \\nsensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word “Google” could \\nbecome so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word “search.” Some courts have ruled that “Google” \\nis a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S., may reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the \\nword “Google” to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand. \\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, \\nprotecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming.

Maintaining and enhancing the brands \\nwithin Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and \\ninnovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and \\nother partners. Our brands have been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and security issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to respond appropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable practices by advertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our brands. \\nFurthermore, failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and \\noperating results.

Although we hedge a portion \\nof our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign \\ncurrencies have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our revenues and earnings.

Examples include laws and regulations regarding: \\n•Competition and\\ttechnology platforms’ business\\tpractices: Laws and regulations focused on large technology \\nplatforms, including the Digital Markets Act in the European Union (EU); regulations and legal settlements in the U.S., \\nSouth Korea, and elsewhere that affect Google Play’s billing policies, fees, and business model; as well as litigation and \\nnew regulations under consideration in a range of jurisdictions.\\n•AI: Laws and regulations focused on the development, use, and provision of AI technologies and other digital products and services, which could result in monetary penalties or other regulatory actions. For example, while legislative text \\nhas yet to be finalized and formally approved, provisional political agreement on a proposed EU AI Act was reached \\nbetween co-legislators in December 2023, including that specific transparency and other requirements would be introduced for general purpose AI systems and the models on which those systems are based.

Our effective \\ntax rates are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with different statutory \\ntax rates, net gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, \\nchanges in our stock price for shares issued as employee compensation, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting \\nprinciples (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws). Further, if we are unable or fail to collect taxes on behalf \\nof customers, employees and partners as the withholding agent, we could become liable for taxes that are levied against third parties. \\nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have received, and \\nmay in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, on various tax-related assertions, such as transfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could harm our financial \\ncondition and operating results, require adverse changes to our business practices, or subject us to additional litigation \\nand regulatory inquiries. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities \\nrequires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may affect our financial results \\nin the period or periods for which such determination is made. \\nFurthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions may \\nbe subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results. For example, \\nvarious jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering revenue-based taxes such as digital services \\ntaxes and other targeted taxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax regimes. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is coordinating negotiations among more than \\n140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies, including the \\nimplementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%. Our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years as a result of these changes.\\n19 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV'),\n",

Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. Further, our \\nshare repurchases could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves and may be \\nsuspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock. \\nThe\\tconcentration\\tof\\tour\\tstock\\townership\\tlimits\\tour\\tstockholders’\\tability\\tto\\tinfluence\\tcorporate matters.\\t\\nOur Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has no voting rights. As of December 31, 2023, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 86.5% of our outstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately 51.5% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Through their stock \\nownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election \\nof directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no voting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive \\nprograms, could continue Larry and Sergey’s current relative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to \\ndetermine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also affect Larry and Sergey’s relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, which could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock. \\nProvisions\\tin\\tour\\tcharter\\tdocuments\\tand\\tunder\\tDelaware\\tlaw\\tcould\\tdiscourage\\ta\\ttakeover\\tthat\\t\\nstockholders\\tmay\\tconsider favorable.\\nProvisions in Alphabet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of \\ncontrol or changes in our management. These provisions include the following: \\n•Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors \\nor the resignation, death, or removal of a director.\\n•Our stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding a \\nstockholders’ meeting.\\n•Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of minority \\nstockholders to elect director candidates.\\n•Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential \\nacquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting \\nto obtain control of our company. \\n•Our Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which makes it \\npossible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede \\nthe success of any attempt to acquire us. \\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock \\nunless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved the \\ntransaction. Our Board of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us. \\nThe\\ttrading\\tprice for\\tour\\tClassA\\tstock\\tand\\tnon-voting ClassC\\tstock\\tmay\\tcontinue tobe\\tvolatile.\\t\\nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile. In addition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading prices of our Class A stock and Class C stock have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate widely, in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, among others, \\nthe activities of our peers and changes in broader economic and political conditions around the world. These broad market \\nand industry factors could harm the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. \\n20 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV'),\n",

Teams of dedicated privacy, safety, and security professionals oversee cybersecurity risk management and mitigation, incident prevention, detection, and remediation. Leadership for these teams are professionals with deep cybersecurity \\nexpertise across multiple industries, including our Vice President of Privacy, Safety, and Security Engineering.

Significant incidents are reviewed regularly by a cross-functional working group to determine whether further \\nescalation is appropriate. Any incident assessed as potentially being or potentially becoming material is immediately \\nescalated for further assessment, and then reported to designated members of our senior management. We consult with outside counsel as appropriate, including on materiality analysis and disclosure matters, and our senior management makes \\nthe final materiality determinations and disclosure and other compliance decisions. Our management apprises Alphabet’s \\nindependent public accounting firm of matters and any relevant developments.\\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee has oversight responsibility for risks and incidents relating to cybersecurity threats, \\nincluding compliance with disclosure requirements, cooperation with law enforcement, and related effects on financial and other \\nrisks, and it reports any findings and recommendations, as appropriate, to the full Board for consideration.

We expect that this evolution will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although at a slower pace than we have experienced historically, in particular after the outsized growth in our advertising revenues during the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and advertisers, which may affect \\nour revenues.\\n•Users\\tcontinue\\tto\\taccess our\\tproducts\\tand\\tservices\\tusing\\tdiverse\\tdevices\\tand\\tmodalities, which\\tallows\\t for\\tnew\\t\\nadvertising\\t formats\\tthat\\tmay\\tbenefit\\tour\\trevenues\\tbut\\tadversely\\taffect\\tour\\tmargins.\\nOur users are accessing our products and services via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables, \\nconnected TVs, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are \\ndoing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and \\ngrow our business.\\nWe benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising formats. \\nThe margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop \\nsearch. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues may be \\naffected. For example, changing dynamics within the global smartphone market, such as increased market saturation in developed countries, can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow and TAC \\nas a percentage of our advertising revenues (“TAC rate”) to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic mix; partner agreement terms; partner mix; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product mix; the relative \\nrevenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.•As\\tonline advertising\\tevolves, we\\tcontinue\\tto expand\\tour\\tproduct\\tofferings,\\twhich\\tmay\\taffect ourmonetization.\\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to expand \\nour product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect our monetization. For example, revenues from \\nads on YouTube and Google Play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads. We also expect to continue to incorporate AI innovations into our products, such as AI in Search, that could affect our monetization trends. When \\ndeveloping new products and services we generally focus first on user experience and then on monetization.\\n26 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV'),\n",

We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and \\nadvertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased revenues from emerging \\nmarkets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as developing markets initially \\nmonetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\\nInternational revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency \\nexchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.\\n•The\\trevenues\\tthat\\twe\\tderive\\tbeyond\\tadvertising\\tare\\tincreasing\\tand\\tmay\\tadversely affect\\tour\\tmargins.\\nRevenues from cloud, consumer subscriptions, platforms, and devices, which may have differing characteristics than our \\nadvertising revenues, have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our products \\nand services.

In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at \\nthe time the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our \\nfinancial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates.

These investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method \\n(“the measurement alternative”) and are measured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward \\nadjustments resulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These adjustments require quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of \\nunobservable inputs. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date \\nand involve the use of estimates using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.\\nNon-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the companies’ \\nfinancial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income \\napproach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount rates, investee revenues and \\ncosts, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. When the quantitative remeasurements of fair value indicate an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its current fair value.\\nWe also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments, i.e. \\nperformance fees. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may \\nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of unobservable inputs.\\nProperty and Equipment\\nWe assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when other changes occur, such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use and utilization \\nof assets, or technological advancements, that could indicate a change in the period over which we expect to benefit from \\nthe assets. \\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\\nRecording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of comparable \\nand resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain tax positions periodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well \\nas the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain \\ntax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for \\nincome taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.\\n41 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV'),\n",

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About \\nMarket Risk\\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity \\ninvestment risks. \\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. International revenues, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. \\nAs discussed below, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency risk. Principal currencies hedged \\nincluded the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, and Japanese yen. For the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was \\nreasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be experienced.\\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities \\ndenominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward and option contracts \\nreduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. \\nThe foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in OI&E, which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts.\\nIf an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets, liabilities, and \\ncommitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would \\nhave resulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately $136 million and $503 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively, after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for the \\nyears ended December 31, 2022 and 2023.\\n42 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV'),\n",

When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option contacts reduce the \\nforeign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign currency forward and option contracts offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not \\nentirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow \\nhedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot rate changes as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them into revenues to offset the hedged \\nexposures as they occur. \\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our cash \\nflow hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion lower as of December 31, 2022 and \\n2023, respectively. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency \\nchange in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.\\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks \\nrelated to investment in foreign subsidiaries.

The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to offset a \\ncorresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity. We invest primarily in debt securities, including government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed \\nand asset-backed securities, money market and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate derivatives. By policy, we \\nlimit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected \\ndue to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. \\nUnrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt securities, we have elected the fair \\nvalue option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. We measure securities for which we have not elected \\nthe fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold, less any expected credit losses. \\nWe use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value of our \\nmarketable debt security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our investment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with 95% \\nconfidence interval.

A hypothetical \\nadverse price change of 10% on our December 31, 2023 balance would decrease the fair value of marketable equity securities by $597 million. From time to time, we may enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our \\nmarketable equity securities.\\nOur non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for \\nobservable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the \\nmeasurement alternative). The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an \\nindication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are in the early stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are \\ntypically in the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience a decline in financial condition, which \\ncould result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. Valuations of our equity investments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data and observable \\ntransactions at lower valuations could result in significant losses. In addition, global economic conditions could result in \\nadditional volatility. The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on the likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of investments through liquidity events such as public offerings, \\nacquisitions, private sales or other market events. Changes in the valuation of non-marketable equity securities may \\nnot directly correlate with changes in valuation of marketable equity securities. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the measurement alternative, \\nwas $28.5 billion and $28.8 billion, respectively. \\nThe carrying values of our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2022 \\nand 2023, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However, these investments could be impaired if the \\ncarrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.\\nFor additional information about our equity investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial \\nStatements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n44 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV'),\n",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nNature of Operations\\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In \\n2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor \\nissuer to Google.\\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide \\nenterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales \\nof other products and services, such as fees received for consumer subscription-based products, apps and in-app \\npurchases, and devices.\\nBasis of Consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\\nUse of Estimates\\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results \\ncould differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including \\nthose related to the allowance for credit losses; content licenses; contingent liabilities; fair values of financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inventory; and useful lives of property and equipment, among others. We base our estimates \\non assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the \\nbasis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the \\nestimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment \\nfrom five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and those placed in service during \\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense of \\n$3.9 billion and an increase in net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.24 per basic and $0.24 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other similar taxes \\nare excluded from revenues. \\nAdvertising Revenues\\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\\n• Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use \\nGoogle.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated properties like \\nGmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\\n• YouTube properties; and\\n•Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, Google Display & \\nVideo 360, and Google Marketing Platform, among others.\\n54 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV'),\n",

We recognize revenues for performance \\nadvertising when a user engages with the advertisement. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues when the ad is \\ndisplayed, or a user views the ad.\\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross \\nbasis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google \\nNetwork properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and amounts \\npaid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising \\ninventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our \\ncustomers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\\nGoogle Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues consist of revenues from:\\n• consumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such YouTube TV, YouTube Music and \\nPremium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\\n• platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases;\\n• devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and\\n•other products and services.\\nSubscription revenues are recognized ratably over the period of the subscription, primarily monthly. We report revenues \\nfrom Google Play app sales and in-app purchases on a net basis, because our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a service fee. \\nGoogle Cloud Revenues\\nGoogle Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:\\n•Google Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, and \\nother services. These services provide access to solutions such as cybersecurity, databases, analytics, and AI offerings \\nincluding our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Duet AI for Google Cloud;\\n•Google Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Duet AI in Google Workspace; and\\n•other enterprise services.\\nOur cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract terms \\nlonger than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when the customer \\nutilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of \\nthe cloud services.\\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenues \\nto each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling \\nprices based on the prices charged to customers.\\nCustomer Incentives and Credits\\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We \\nestimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe that \\nthere will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.\\nSales Commissions\\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We recognize an \\nasset for certain sales commissions and amortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one year. These costs are \\nrecorded within sales and marketing expenses.\\n55 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV'),\n",

Our distribution \\npartners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers; and\\n•amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\\n• Other cost of revenues includes:\\n•compensation expense related to our data centers and other operations such as content review and customer and product support;\\n•content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for \\ndistribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee);\\n•depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure; and\\n•inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell.\\nSoftware Development Costs\\nWe expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. Technological \\nfeasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. As a result, development costs that meet the \\ncriteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.\\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud-based \\napplications used to deliver our services.

Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for \\nthe periods presented.\\nStock-based Compensation \\nStock-based compensation (SBC) primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity classified \\nand measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense using the \\nstraight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.\\nFor RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be paid by us \\non behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and the income tax \\nwithholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\\nAdditionally, SBC includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) that include market \\nconditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bet companies. PSUs and certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period. Certain \\nawards granted by Other Bet companies are liability classified and remeasured at fair value through settlement. The fair \\nvalue of awards granted by Other Bet companies is based on the equity valuation of the respective Other Bet company.\\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended December\\xa031, 2021,\\xa02022, and 2023, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $7.9 billion, $9.2 billion, and $8.7 billion, \\nrespectively.\\nPerformance Fees\\nPerformance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments. \\nWe record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may result in expense \\nrecognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of unobservable \\ninputs.

As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined \\nbased on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and liabilities recorded at \\nfair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value:\\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\\nLevel 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical \\nor similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models \\nproject future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs \\nincluding interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable \\ninputs when measuring fair value. The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate valuation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models.\\nOur financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents, marketable \\nsecurities, derivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets measured at \\nfair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and liabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.\\nWe measure certain other instruments, including SBC awards settled in the stock of Other Bet companies, and certain \\nassets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. \\nFinancial Instruments\\nOur financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative financial instruments and accounts receivable.\\nCredit Risks\\nWe are subject to credit risk primarily from cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, derivative financial instruments, including foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. We manage our credit risk exposure through timely \\nassessment of our counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits and use of collateral management. Foreign exchange \\ncontracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. We manage our credit risk \\nexposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend. We \\ngenerally do not require collateral from our customers.\\nCash Equivalents\\nWe invest excess cash primarily in government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, time deposits, and money market funds.\\nMarketable Securities\\nWe classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities on our \\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable debt securities \\nat the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date.

We account for non-marketable equity securities through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method. All \\nother non-marketable equity securities that we hold are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative. \\nUnder the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. \\nAdjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and are recorded as a \\ncomponent of OI&E.\\nNon-marketable securities that do not have effective contractual maturity dates are classified as other non-current assets \\non the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\nSee Note 3 for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments. \\nAccounts Receivable\\nOur payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the types and locations of our customers and the products or services \\noffered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and \\ncustomers, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. Additionally, accounts \\nreceivable includes amounts for services performed in advance of the right to invoice the customer.\\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts \\nreceivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements \\nof Income. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In \\ndetermining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due \\nstatus and make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider customer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of \\nfuture economic conditions.\\nOther\\nOur financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also entered into \\ncommercial arrangements at or near the same time.

Additionally, if our investment in such companies becomes \\nimpaired, any remaining performance obligations would be reassessed and may be reduced.\\nImpairment of Investments\\nWe periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment. \\nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is estimated by \\nconsidering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past events, current \\nconditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to OI&E, not to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in AOCI. If we have an intent to sell, or if it is \\nmore likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized \\ncost basis, we will write down the security to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as a component of OI&E. \\n58 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV'),\n",

Cost is computed using the first-in, first-out method.\\nVariable Interest Entities\\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in which we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are the primary \\nbeneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most significantly \\naffect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance \\nwith applicable GAAP.\\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of \\nwhether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. \\nProperty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets, construction in progress, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, \\noffices, data centers, and related building improvements. Information technology assets include servers and network \\nequipment. Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service. \\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line \\nmethod over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate. Land is not depreciated. We depreciate buildings over periods of seven to 25 years. We depreciate information technology assets generally over a period of six \\nyears for servers and network equipment. We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease \\nterm or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation for buildings, information technology assets, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures commences once they are ready for our intended use.\\nGoodwill\\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we \\nreassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually, or \\nmore frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.\\nLeases\\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily include \\npayments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments \\nand account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities.\\nCertain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease \\nassets and liabilities.

Lease assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives.\\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our \\noperating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is included in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease liabilities are \\nincluded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.\\nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\\nWe review leases, property and equipment, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when events or \\nchanges in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest \\nlevel of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the \\ncarrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by \\nwhich the carrying value exceeds its fair value. \\nIncome Taxes\\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes payable \\nor refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that \\nhave been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax assets and liabilities \\nbased on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that \\nthey will not be realized or release a valuation allowance to increase deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that \\nthey will be realized.

In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a \\ncomponent of the income tax provision.\\nBusiness Combinations\\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, except for \\nrevenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The excess of the \\npurchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\\nForeign Currency\\nWe translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for revenues, \\ncosts, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders’ equity.

The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.\\nThe following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities measured at fair value on a recurring \\nbasis (in millions):\\nAs of December 31, 2022\\nFair Value \\nHierarchyAdjusted \\nCostGross \\nUnrealized \\nGainsGross \\nUnrealized \\nLosses Fair ValueCash and Cash \\nEquivalentsMarketable \\nSecurities\\nFair value changes \\nrecorded in other comprehensive income\\nTime deposits Level 2 $\\x08 5,297 $\\x08 0 $\\x08 0 $\\x08 5,297 $\\x08 5,293 $\\x08 4\\nGovernment bonds Level 2 41,036 64 (2,045) 39,055 283 38,772\\nCorporate debt securities Level 2 28,578 8 (1,569) 27,017 1 27,016\\nMortgage-backed and \\nasset-backed securities Level 2 16,176 5 (1,242) 14,939 0 14,939\\nTotal investments with fair value change reflected in other comprehensive income\\n(1)$\\x08 91,087 $\\x08 77 $\\x08 (4,856) $\\x08 86,308 $\\x08 5,577 $\\x08 80,731\\nFair value adjustments recorded in net income\\nMoney market funds Level 1 $\\x08 7,234 $\\x08 7,234 $\\x08 0\\nCurrent marketable equity \\nsecurities\\n(2)Level 1\\n4,013 0 4,013\\nMutual funds Level 2 339 0 339\\nGovernment bonds Level 2 1,877 440 1,437\\nCorporate debt securities Level 2 3,744 65 3,679\\nMortgage-backed and asset-backed securitiesLevel 2\\n1,686 2 1,684\\nTotal investments with fair value change recorded in net income $\\x08 18,893 $\\x08 7,741 $\\x08 11,152\\nCash 0 8,561 0\\nTotal $\\x08 91,087 $\\x08 77 $\\x08 (4,856) $\\x08 105,201 $\\x08 21,879 $\\x08 91,883\\n(1)Represents gross unrealized gains and losses for debt securities recorded to AOCI.\\n(2)The\\x08long-term\\x08portion\\x08of\\x08marketable\\x08equity\\x08securities\\x08(subject\\x08to\\x08long-term\\x08lock-up\\x08restrictions)\\x08of\\x08$803\\x08million\\x08as\\x08of\\x08December\\x0831,\\xa02022is included within other non-current assets.\\n63 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV'),\n",

We also enter into derivative \\ninstruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns.\\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily \\nwithin Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\\nCash Flow Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have maturities of \\n24 months or less.\\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and subsequently \\nreclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings.

In September 2023, we reached a settlement in principle with 50 state Attorneys \\nGeneral and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated the trial date with the states, and any final approval of the settlement is expected to occur in 2024. In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations \\ninto Google Play’s business practices. Korean regulators are investigating Google Play’s billing practices, including a \\nformal review in May 2022 of Google’s compliance with the new app store billing regulations. \\nWe believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\\nPrivacy Matters \\nWe are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations and litigation \\nin the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information and advertising practices, \\nwhich could result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes. \\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others’ intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may \\nsinclude awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from \\noffering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices \\nand develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm \\nour business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to \\nlitigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an \\nadverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating \\nworkarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against certain \\nintellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may \\nrequire that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and \\npartners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\\nOther\\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial \\ndisputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, \\npersonal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, in December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in \\nEpic Games v. Google  finding that Google violated antitrust laws related to Google Play’s business. The presiding \\njudge will determine remedies in 2024, and the range of potential remedies vary widely. We plan to appeal. We also \\nperiodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. \\nThese claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in \\nsubstantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse \\nconsequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding penalties have \\nbeen imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including those of sanctioned \\nparties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\\n78 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV'),\n",

Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions received \\nfor Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\\n•Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a \\nconsolidated level.

Additionally, \\nbeginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation methodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current \\npresentation.\\nAs announced on April 20, 2023, we brought together part of Google Research (the Brain team) and DeepMind to \\nsignificantly accelerate our progress in artificial intelligence (AI). The group, called Google DeepMind, is reported within Alphabet-level activities prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2023. Previously, the Brain team was included \\nwithin Google Services.\\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily \\ninclude AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such \\nas our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including \\ncertain fines and settlements. Charges associated with reductions in our workforce and office space during 2023 were not allocated to our segments.

General  \\nThe accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshi re Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire” \\nor “Company”) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling fina ncial \\ninterest s as of the financial statement date. In these notes the terms “us,” “we,” or “our” ref er to Berkshire and its consolidated \\nsubsidiaries.  Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10 -K (“Annual Report”) that included \\ninformation necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire’s businesses and financial state ment presentations. Our significant \\naccounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. \\nCertain immaterial amounts in 20 10 have been reclassified  to conform with the current yea r presentation. Financial information in this \\nReport reflects any adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, nec essary to \\na fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with acco unting principles generally accepted in the United States \\n(“GAAP”).  \\nFor a number of reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The \\ntiming and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by i nsurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of \\ndetermining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be relatively more significant to results of interim periods than to \\nresults for a full year. Variations in th e amounts and timing of investment gains/losses can cause significant variations in periodic net \\nearnings. Investment gains/losses are recorded when investments are sold or are other -than-temporarily impaired . In addition, changes \\nin the fair value of deri vative assets/liabilities associated with derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment \\ncan cause significant variations in periodic net earnings.  \\nNote 2.     New accounting pronouncements  \\nIn October 2010, the FASB issued A ccounting Standards Update (“ASU ”) 2010- 26, “Accounting for Costs Associated with \\nAcquiring or Renewing Insurance Contracts.” ASU 2010 -26 modifies the types of costs incurred by insurance entities that are deferred \\nin the acquiring or renewing of insurance  contracts. ASU 2010- 26 requires that only direct incremental costs related to successful \\nefforts are capitalized. Capitalized costs may include certain advertising costs which are allowed to  be capitalized if the primary \\npurpose of the advertising is to e licit sales to customers proven to have responded directly to the advertising and the probable future \\nrevenues generated from the advertising are proven to be in excess of expected future costs to be incurred in realizing those revenues. \\nASU 2010- 26 is eff ective for fiscal years  and interim periods beginning after December  15, 2011 and may be applied on a prospective \\nor retrospective basis. We are evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU 2010 -26 will have on our Consolidated Financial \\nStatements.  \\nIn December 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010- 28, “When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting \\nUnits with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts.” ASU 2010 -28 modifies Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units \\nwith zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test is required if it is more likely  \\nthan not that a goodwill impairment exists, after considering whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating th at an  \\nimpairment may exist. ASU 2010- 28 is effective prospectively for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December  15, \\n2011. We do not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2010- 28 will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\nNote 3.    Significant business acquisitions  \\nOur long- held acquisition strategy is to purchase businesses with consistent earning power, good returns on equity and able and \\nhonest management at sensible prices.  \\nOn February  12, 2010, we acquired all of th e outstanding common stock of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation that \\nwe did not already own (about 264.5 million shares or 77.5%) for aggregate consideration of $26.5 billion that consisted of cash of \\napproximately $15.9 billion with the remaind er in Berkshire common stock (80,931 Class  A shares and 20,976,621 Class B shares). \\nApproximately 50% of the cash component was funded with existing cash balances and the remaining 50% was funded with proceeds  \\nfrom debt issued by Berkshire. The acquisition was completed through the merger of a wholly -owned merger subsidiary (a Delaware \\nlimited liability company) and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation. The merger subsidiary was the surviving entity and w as \\nrenamed Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BN SF”). BNSF is based in Fort Worth, Texas, and through BNSF Railway Company \\noperates one of the largest railroad systems in North America with approximately 32,000 route miles (including 23,000 route m iles of \\ntrack owned by BNSF) of track in 28 states and t wo Canadian provinces.

Significant business acquisitions  (Continued)  \\nPrior to February  12, 2010, we owned 76.8 million shares of BNSF (22.5% of the outstanding shares), which were acquire d \\nbetween August 2006 and January 2009. We accounted for those shares pursuant to the equity method and as of February  12, 2010, \\nour investment had a carrying value of $6.6  billion. We are accounting for the acquisition of BNSF pursuant to the acquisition method \\nunder Accounting Standards Codification Section  805 Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). Upon completion of the acquisition of \\nthe remaining BNSF shares, we were required under ASC 805 to re -measure our previously owned investment in BNSF at fair value \\nas of the acquisition date. In the first quarter of 2010, we recognized a one- time holding gain of approximately $1 billion for the \\ndifference between the fair value of the BNSF shares and our carrying value under the equity method. BNSF’s financial stat ements are \\nincluded in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning as of February 13, 2010.  \\nIn the first quarter of 2011, we acquired 16.5% of the outstanding common stock of Marmon Holdings, Inc. (“Marmon”) for \\napproximately $1.5 billion in cash, thus  increasing our ownership to 80.2%.  We have owned a controlling interest in Marmon since \\n2008. We increased our interests in the underlying assets and liabilities of Marmon ; however,  under current GAAP, the excess of the \\npurchase price over the carrying value of the noncontrolling interests acquired i s not allocable to assets or liabilities. Accordingly, we \\nrecorded a charge of approximately $600 million to capital in excess of par value in our consolidated shareholders’ equity  on \\nDecember 31, 2010 in conn ection with this transaction . \\nOn March 13, 2011, Berkshire and The Lubrizol  Corporation (“Lubrizol”) entered into a merger agreement, whereby Berkshire \\nwill acquire all of the outstanding shares of Lubrizol common stock for cash of $135 per share. The aggr egate merger consideration is \\nexpected to be approximately $9.0 billion. The acquisition is subject to the approval of Lubrizol shareholders and is also su bject to \\nvarious regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The acquisition is curr ently expected to close in the third quarter \\nof 2011.  \\nLubrizol  is an innovative specialty chemical company that produces and supplies technologies to customers in the global \\ntransportation, industrial and consumer markets. These technologies include lubri cant additives for engine oils, other transportation -\\nrelated fluids and industrial lubricants, as well as fuel additives for gasoline and diesel fuel. In addition, Lubrizol makes  ingredients \\nand additives for personal care products and pharmaceuticals; specialty materials, including plastics technology; and performance \\ncoatings in the form of specialty resins and additives. Lubrizol’s industry -leading technologies in additives, ingredients and \\ncompounds enhance the quality, performance and value of customer s’ products, while reducing their environmental impact. For the \\nyear end ed December 31, 201 0, Lubrizol reported consolidated revenues of $5.4 billion and net earnings of $732 million.  \\nNote 4.

Investments in equity securities (Continued)  \\nDuring the first quarter of 2011, we recorded other -than- temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses in earnings of $506 million \\nrelated to certain equit y securities. The charge to earnings was offset by a reduction in unrealized losses recorded in other \\ncomprehensive income resulting in no impact on our  consolidated shareholders’ equity. Included in the OTTI loss es was $ 337 million \\nrelated to 103.6 millio n shares of our  Wells Fargo  & Company investment. These shares had an aggregate original cost of $ 3,621  \\nmillion. We also hold  an additional 255.4 million  shares of Wells Fargo which were acquired at an aggregate cost of $4,394 million . \\nThese shares had an unrealized gain of $ 3,704 million as of March 31, 2011. Due to the length of time that certain of our Wells Fargo \\nshares were in a continuous unrealized loss position and because we account for gains and losses on a specific identification  basis, \\naccountin g regulations required us to record the unrealized losses in earnings. However, the unrealized gains are not reflected in \\nearnings but are instead recorded directly in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.  \\nNote 6.

Under its terms, the GS \\nPreferred is redeem able at any time by GS at a price of $110,000 per share ($5.5  billion in aggregate). In March 2011 , GS notified us \\nthat it would redeem our  GS Preferred investment in its entirety and on April 18, 2011, we received the redemption proceeds  of $5.5 \\nbillion . The GS Warrants remain outstanding and expire in 2013 and can be exercised for an aggregate cost o f $5 billion ($115/share). \\nIn 2008, we also acquired 30,000 shares of 10% Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of GE (“GE Preferred”) and warrants to \\npurchase 134,831,460 shares of common stock of GE (“GE Warrants”) for a combined cost of $3 billion. The G E Preferred may be \\nredeemed by GE beginning in October 2011 at a price of $110,000 per share ($3.3  billion in aggregate). The GE Warrants expire in \\n2013 and can be exercised for an additional aggregate cost of $3  billion ($22.25/share).  \\nIn 2008, we acquir ed $4.4 billion par amount of 11.45% Wrigley subordinated notes due in 2018 and $2.1 billion of 5% Wrigley \\npreferred stock .

Consumer loan amounts are net of acquisition \\ndiscounts of $567 million at March  31, 2011  and $5 80 million at December  31, 201 0. At March 31, 201 1, approximately 96%  of \\nconsumer installment loan balances were evaluated collectively for impairment whereas about 91%  of commercial loan balances were \\nevaluated individually fo r impairment.  \\nAs a part of the evaluation process, credit quality indicators are reviewed and loans are designated as performing or non -\\nperforming. At March  31, 2011, approximately 98% of consumer  installment and commercial loan balances were determined to  be \\nperforming and approximately 9 4% of those balances were current as to payment status.

We received the premiums on these contracts in full at the contract inception dates and \\ntherefore we have no counterparty credit risk.

Derivative contracts (Continued)  \\nThe high yield index contracts are comprised of specified North American corporate issuers (usually 100 in number at \\ninception) whose obligations a re rated below investment grade. High yield contracts remaining in -force at March  31, 2011 expire no \\nlater than 2013. State and municipality contracts are comprised of over 500 state and municipality issuers and had a weighted average \\ncontract life at March  31, 2011 of approximately 9.9 years. Potential obligations related to approximately 50% of the notional value of \\nthe state and municipality contracts cannot be settled before the maturity dates of the underlying obligations, which range f rom 2019 \\nto 2054.   \\nPremiums on the high yield index and state/municipality contracts are received in full at the inception dates of the contract s and, \\nas a result, we have no counterparty credit risk. Our payment obligations under certain of these contracts are on a first  loss basis. \\nLosses under other contracts are subject to aggregate deductibles that must be satisfied before we have any payment obligatio ns.  \\nIndividual corporate credit default contracts primarily relate to issuers of investment grade obligations. In mos t instances, \\npremiums are due from counterparties on a quarterly basis over the terms of the contracts. As of March  31, 2011, all of the remaining \\ncontracts in -force will expire in 2013.   \\nWith limited exceptions, our equity index put option and credit defa ult contracts contain no collateral posting requirements with \\nrespect to changes in either the fair value or intrinsic value of the contracts and/or a downgrade of Berkshire’s credit rati ngs. As of \\nMarch  31, 2011, our collateral posting requirement under c ontracts with collateral provisions was $ 20 million compared to \\n$31 million at December  31, 2010. As of March 31, 2011, had Berkshire’s credit ratings (currently AA+ from Standard & Poor’s and \\nAa2 from Moody’s) been downgraded below either A - by Standard  & Poor’s or A3 by Moody’s an additional $1.1 billion would have \\nbeen required to be posted as collateral.  \\nOur railroad and regulated utility subsidiaries are exposed to variations in the market prices in the purchases and sales of natural \\ngas and electrici ty and in the purchase of fuel. Derivative instruments, including forward purchases and sales, futures, swaps and \\noptions, are used to manage these price risks. Unrealized gains and losses under the contracts of our regulated utilities tha t are \\nprobable of  recovery through rates are recorded as a regulatory net asset or liability. Unrealized gains or losses on contracts accounted  \\nfor as cash flow or fair value hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or in net earnings, as appropriate. Derivative contract assets included in other assets of railroad, utilities and energy businesses were $252 million and $231  million as of \\nMarch 31, 2011 and December  31, 2010, respectively.

Considerable \\njudgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. A ccordingly, the estimates presented \\nherein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in an actual current market exchange. The use of different \\nmarket assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value.  \\nThe hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3.  \\nLevel 1  – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Substantially \\nall of our equity inve stments are traded on an exchange in active markets and fair values are based on the closing prices as of the \\nbalance sheet date.  \\nLevel 2  – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for  similar \\nassets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in  inactive \\nmarkets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and \\nyield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived p rincipally \\nfrom or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Fair values for our inv estments in fixed maturity \\nsecurities are primarily based on price evaluations which incorporate market prices for identical instruments in inactive mar kets \\nand market data available for instruments with similar characteristics. Pricing evaluations general ly reflect discounted expected \\nfuture cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit rating, estima ted \\nduration, and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector .

Fair value measurements  (Continued)  \\nLevel 3  – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities.

Unobservable inputs require management to make certain \\nprojections  and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in pricing assets or liabilities. \\nMeasurements of non -exchange traded derivative contracts and certain other investments carried at fair value are based \\nprimarily on valuation  models, discounted cash flow models or other valuation techniques that are believed to be used by market \\nparticipants. We value equity index put option contracts based on the Black -Scholes option valuation model which we believe is \\nwidely used by market p articipants. Inputs to this model include current index price, expected volatility, dividend and interest \\nrates and contract duration. Credit default contracts are primarily valued based on indications of bid or offer data as of th e \\nbalance sheet date. These contracts are not exchange traded and certain of the terms of our contracts are not standard in \\nderivatives markets. For example, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts. For these reasons, we \\nclassified these contracts as Lev el 3. \\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis in our financial statements are \\nsummarized , according to the hierarchy previously described , as follows (in  millions).  \\n  Total \\nFair Value  \\n  Quoted  \\nPrices \\n(Level 1)   \\n  Significant  Other \\nObservable   Inputs \\n(Level 2)   \\n  Significant  \\nUnobservable   Inputs \\n(Level 3)   \\n  \\nMarch  31, 2011          \\nInvestments in fixed maturity securities:          \\nU.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and \\nagencies  ................................ ................................ .  $ 2,146   $ 563  $ 1,580   $ 3  \\nStates, municipalities and political subdivisions  ........    3,437    —     3,436    1  \\nForeign governments  ................................ .................    12,327    5,073    7,140    114  \\nCorporate bonds  ................................ .........................    14,120    —     13,471    649  \\nMortgage -backed securities  ................................ .......    2,995    —     2,995    —    \\nInvestments in equity securities  ................................ ...........    63,239    63,108    87   44  \\nOther investments  ................................ ................................    17,270    —     5,500    11,770   \\n     \\nNet derivative contract (assets)/liabilities:      \\nRailroad, utilities and energy  ................................ .....    320   —     (21)  341  \\nFinance and financial prod ucts:     \\nEquity index put options ................................ ...    6,489    —     —     6,489   \\nCredit default obligations  ................................ .   1,186    —     —     1,186   \\nOther  ................................ ................................ .   44   —     116   (72 ) \\n     \\nDecember  31, 2010          \\nInvestments in fixed maturity securities:          \\nU.S. Treasury , U.S. government corporations and \\nagencies  ................................ ................................ .  $ 2,197   $ 535  $ 1,658   $ 4  \\nStates, municipalities and political subdivisions  ........    3,581    —     3,581    —    \\nForeign governments  ................................ .................    11,912    5,633    6,167    112  \\nCorporate bonds  ................................ .........................    14,054    23   13,346    685  \\nMortgage -backed securities  ................................ .......    3,139    —     3,139    —    \\nInvestments in equity securities  ................................ ...........    61,513    61,390    88   35  \\nOther investments  ................................ ................................    17,589    —     —     17,589   \\n     \\nNet derivative contract (assets)/liabilities:          \\nRailroad, utilities and e nergy  ................................ .....    390   7   52   331  \\nFinance and financial products:          \\nEquity index put options ................................ ...    6,712    —     —     6,712   \\nCredit default obligations  ................................ .   1,239    —     —     1,239   \\nOther  ................................ ................................ .   77   —     137   (60 ) '),\n",

There are essentially no centralized or integrated \\nbusiness functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by our c orporate \\nheadquarters in the day -to-day business ac tivities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participate s in \\nand is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Ch ief Executive \\nto head each of the operat ing businesses. It also is responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire’s corporate governance \\nefforts, including, but not limited to, communicating the appropriate “tone at the top” messages to its employees and associa tes, \\nmonitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses , and participating in the resolution of governance -related \\nissues as needed. The business segment data (Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with \\nthis discussio n.  \\nOn February 12, 2010, we completed the acquisition of the 77.5% of BNSF common stock that we did not already own. \\nBeginning as of February 13, 2010, BNSF’s results and net earnings are included fully in our consolidated results and net ear nings. \\nPrior to February 13, 2010, our share of net earnings related to our previously held investments in BNSF was determined under the \\nequity method and is included as a component of insurance investment income in the preceding table.  \\nDuring the first quarter of 2011 , insurance underwriting results of our reinsurance operations include d after-tax losses of \\napproximately $1.1  billion from several significant catastrophe events in 2011. After -tax losses from catastrophes occurring in the first \\nquarter of 2010 were approximately $3 40 million .  \\nInvestment and derivative losses in the first quarter of 2011  included after -tax other -than- temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses \\nrelated to certain equity securities of approximately $322 million. OTTI losses  have no  impact on our consolidated shareholders’ \\nequity.  In 2010, investment gains/losses included a one -time holding gain of approximately $1 billion related to our acquisition of \\nBNSF.  See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that  realized investment g ains/losses and OTTI losses are \\noften meaningless in terms of understanding our reported results or evaluating our economic performance.  T hese gains and losses and \\nchanges in the equity and credit markets from period to period have caused and may continue  to cause significant volatility in our \\nperiodic earnings.  \\nInsurance —Underwriting  \\nWe engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks. In primary insurance activities, we assum e \\ndefined portions of the risks of loss fro m persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we \\nassume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own \\ninsuring activities. Our ins urance and reinsurance businesses are: (1)  GEICO, (2) General Re, (3)  Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance \\nGroup (“BHRG”) and (4) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Through General Re and BHRG, we also reinsure life and health risks.  \\n '),\n",

Management’s Disc ussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  \\nInsurance —Underwriting  (Continued)  \\nOur management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations –  underwriting and investing. Underwriting \\ndecisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing, with very  limited exceptions, is the responsibility of Berkshire’s \\nChairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation o f \\ninvestment income.  \\nOur periodic underwriting results are affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment \\nexpenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses produce \\nsignificant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to BHRG and General Re. In the first qua rter of \\n2011, we recorded aggregate provisions for estimated catastrophe losses of approximately $1.7 billion arising from several current \\nyear events , including the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand, as well as a cyclone and floods in Australia. Substantially all of our  \\nlosses from these events were unpaid as of March 31. Our unpaid losses are based on our estimates of the ultimat e insurance and \\nreinsurance claims that will be settled and paid over time . Actual claim settlements and revised loss estimates will develop over time , \\nwhich  will likely differ from the estimates recorded as of March 31. Accordingly, t he loss reserve estim ates recorded as of March 31 \\nmay develop upward or downward in future periods with a corresponding decrease or increase, respectively, to pre -tax earnings.  Our \\nunderwriting results also include significant unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and  losses arising from the valuation of \\ncertain non -U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities into U.S. Dollars as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. \\nGiven the magnitude of the first quarter catastrophe losses, as well as the potential for additional losses from hurricanes in the U.S. \\nbetween June and December, we believe it is unlikely that our combined insurance operations will achieve an underwriting profit for \\nthe year ending December 31, 2011.  \\nA key marketing strategy followed  by all of our insurance businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength. \\nStatutory surplus of our insurance businesses was approximately $94 billion at December  31, 2010. This superior capital strength \\ncreates opportunities, especially wit h respect to reinsurance activities, to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts \\nspecially designed to meet the unique needs of insurance and reinsurance buyers.   \\nA summary follows of underwriting results from our insurance businesses .

The growth in premiums earned for voluntary auto was 6.5%, as policies -in-force increased 6.8% during the past year. The \\nincrease in policies -in-force reflects an increase of 17.5% in voluntary auto new business sales over the first quarter of 2010 and \\nhigher retention rates of existing customers. Voluntary auto policies -in-force at March  31, 2011 were approximately 319,000 greater \\nthan at December  31, 2010 and were approximately 882,000 greater than at December 31, 2009.  \\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2011 were $2,653 mi llion, an increase of $121 million \\n(4.8%) versus the first quarter of 2010. The loss ratio was 72.2% in the first quarter of 2011 compared to 73.3% in 2010. Claims \\nfrequencies in 2011 for property damage and collision coverages have increased in the one to  three percent range and frequencies for \\ninjury coverages have increased in the two to four percent range  compared with 2010.  Physical damage severities in 2011 have increased \\nin the one to three percent range and bodily injury severities have increased i n the four to seven percent range from 2010.  Personal injury \\nprotection severities increas ed in the seven to ten percent range .  \\nUnderwriting expenses in the first quarter of 2011 were $685 million, an increase of $62 million ( 10.0% ) over 20 10. The \\nincrease was a result of additional advertising and payroll costs arising from the generation of  new business and the servicing of \\nexisting business.   \\nGeneral Re  \\nThrough General Re, we conduct a reinsurance business offering property and casualty and life and health coverages to clients \\nworldwide. We write property and casualty reinsurance in North America on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporat ion \\nand internationally through Germany- based General Reinsurance AG and other wholly -owned affiliates. Property and casualty \\nreinsurance is also written through brokers with respect to Faraday in London. Life and health reinsurance is written in Nort h America \\nthrough General Re Life Corporation and internationally through General Reinsurance AG. Gener al Re strives to generate \\nunderwriting profits in essentially all of its product lines, without consideration of investment income. Our management does  not \\nevaluate underwriting performance based upon market share and our underwriters exercise discipline b y rejecting  inadequately priced \\nrisks. General Re’s underwriting results are summarized in the following table. Amounts are in  millions.  \\n  \\n     \\n  First Quarter   \\n  \\n  Premiums earned   \\n  Pre-tax underwriting  gain (loss)  \\n  \\n  2011  \\n  2010  \\n  2011  \\n  2010  \\n  \\nProperty/casualty  ................................ ................................ ...............   $ 715  $ 749  $ (324) $ (61) \\nLife/health  ................................ ................................ ..........................    722   691   (2)  22  \\n        $1,437   $1,440   $ (326) $ (39) \\n        \\nProperty/casualty  \\nProperty/casualty premiums earned in the first quarter of 2011 were $715 million , a decli ne of $34 million (4.5%) compared to \\n2010. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums earned in the first quarter 2011 declined $48 million \\n(6.4% ), which was primarily due to lower  volume in North American treaty business , partially offset by slightly higher premiums in \\ninternational markets .

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  \\nInsurance —Underwriting (Continued)  \\nGeneral Re (Continued)  \\nLife/health  \\nPremiums earned in the first quarter of 2011 were $722 million, an increase of $31 million (4.5%) over 2010.  Adjusting for the \\neffects of foreign currency  exchange rate changes , premiums earned increased 1.7% over the first quarter of 2010.  The increase in \\npremiums earned was primarily due to increased life business in several markets outside of the United States , partially offset by lower \\nvolume in the U.S . The global life/health operations produced underwriting loss es of $2 million in 2011 as compared to underwriting \\ngains of $22 million in 2010.  The first quarter underwriting loss es included claim reserve incr eases of $40 million related to the \\nearthquakes in Japan and New Zealand in our international operations and reflected increases in frequency and severity of life and \\nhealth claims in the U.S. The underwriting gains  in the first quarter of 2010 were  princi pally due to favorable mortality in our global \\nlife business.  \\nBerkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group  \\nThrough the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, we underwrite excess -of-loss reinsurance and quota -share coverages on \\nproperty and casualty risks for in surers and reinsurers worldwide. BHRG’s business includes catastrophe excess -of-loss reinsurance \\nand excess primary and facultative reinsurance for large or otherwise unusual discrete property risks referred to as individu al risk. \\nBHRG also writes retroactive reinsurance, which provides indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past \\nloss events. Other multi -line business refers to other property and casualty business written on both a quota -share and excess basis and \\nincludes a five -year 20% quota -share contract with Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd. (“Swiss Re”)  covering substantially all of Swiss \\nRe’s property/casualty risks incepting from January  1, 2008. We currently do not anticipate that the Swiss Re quota -share contract will \\nbe renewed or extended. BHRG’s underwriting activities include life reinsurance as well as a life annuity business. BHRG’s \\nunderwriting results are summarized in the table below. Amounts are in  millions.  \\n     \\n  First Quarter   \\n  \\n  Premiums earned   \\n  Pre-tax underwriting  gain (loss)  \\n  \\n  2011  \\n  2010  \\n  2011  \\n  2010  \\n  Catastrophe and individual risk ................................ ........................   $ 189  $ 162  $ (273) $ 118  \\nRetroactive reinsurance  ................................ ................................ ....    143   147   (155)  (155) \\nOther multi -line property/casualty  ................................ ...................    1,133    839   (910)  127  \\nLife and annuity  ................................ ................................ ...............    479   959   (5)  (38) \\n        $ 1,944   $ 2,107   $(1,343 ) $ 52  \\n      \\nPremiums earned in the first quarter of 2011 from catastrophe and individual risk contracts increased  $27 million ( 17%)  versus \\nthe first quarter of 20 10. The level of business written in a given period will vary significantly due to changes in market conditions and \\nmanagement’s assessment of the adequacy of premium rates. We constrained the volume of business written in 2011 and 2010 as \\npremium rates have not been at tractive enough to warrant increasing volume.  However, we have the capacity and willingness to write \\nsubstantially more business when appropriate pricing can be obtained.   \\nCatastrophe and individual risk underwriting results for the first quarter of 2011  included estimated losses of $454 million from \\nthe earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand.  U nderwriting results for the first quarter of 2010 included estimated losses of $82 million \\nfrom the earthquake in Chil e partially offset by favorable development of  prior years’ loss reserves.  \\nRetroactive policies generally provide very large, but limited, indemnification of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  \\nwith respect to past loss events that are generally expected to be paid over long periods of time. T he underwriting losses from \\nretroactive policies primarily represent the periodic amortization of deferred charges established at the inception of the co ntracts. At \\nMarch  31, 2011, unamortized deferred charges for all of BHRG’s retroactive contracts were approximately $3. 6 billion and gross \\nunpaid losses were approximately $18 .8 billion.  \\nPremiums earned in the first quarter of 2011 and 2010 from other multi -line property and casualty business included $785 \\nmillion and $598 million , respectively,  from the S wiss Re quota -share contract.  Other multi -line property and casualty business \\nproduced underwriting losses in the first quarter of 2011 of $910 million compared with underwriting gains of $127 million in 2010. \\nUnderwriting results in 2011 included estimat ed catastrophe losses from the Swiss Re quota -share contract of $ 701 million , primarily \\narising from the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand. Catastrophe losses in 2010 were $140 million from the earthquake in Chile . \\nUnderwriting results also included los ses of $173 million in the first quarter of 2011 and gains of $130 million in the first quarter of \\n2010 from unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the conversion of certain reinsurance loss reserve s \\nand other liabilities den ominated in foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars as of the balance sheet dates.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  \\nInsurance —Underwriting (Continued)  \\nBerkshire Hathaway Reinsurance G roup (Continued)  \\nLife and annuity premiums earned in 2011 primarily derived from a  life reinsurance contract that was completed in January 2010 \\nwith Swiss Re Life  & Health America Inc. (“SRLHA”) and from the life reinsurance business acquired from Sun Life  Assurance \\nCompany of Canada (“Sun Life”)  as of December 31 , 2010 .  Substantially all of the life and annuity premiums earned in 2010 were \\nfrom the SRLHA contract , which provides that BHRG assume the liabilities and subsequent premium renewals on a closed block of \\ncertain yearly renewable term reinsurance business written, assumed or a cquired by SRLHA effective as of October 1, 2009.  \\nPremiums earned in the first quarter of 2010 included approximately $600 million for the period between the October 1, 2009 \\neffective date and closing of the transaction  in January 2010.   Underwriting losses of the life and annuity business were $5 million for \\nthe first quarter of 2011 and $38 million for the first quarter of 2010.  The underwriting losses in 2011 included a $30 million \\nunderwriting gain from the Sun Life business .  The underwriting results of the life and annuity business also included periodic interest \\ncharges arising from accretion of discounted annuity reserves.  \\nOn April  19, 2011, Eaglestone Reinsurance Com pany (“Eaglestone”), a subsidiary of American International Group, Inc., \\n(“AIG”), and National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), a member of the BHRG, entered into an agreement pursuant to which, at \\nclosing, Eaglestone and other AIG affiliates and NICO will ente r into a reinsurance agreement  and related agreements whereby NICO \\nreinsures the bulk of AIG’s U.S. asbestos liabilities, excluding asbestos accounts that AIG believes have already been reserv ed to their \\nlimit of liability or certain other ancillary asbes tos exposure assumed by AIG insurance company subsidiaries. Under the agreements \\nNICO will receive premiums of approximately $1.65 billion. NICO’s overall limit of liability under the agreements is $3.5  billion. \\nThe transaction contemplated by the agreemen t is subject to AIG’s receipt of required regulatory approvals, execution of definitive \\ntransaction documentation and satisfaction of other conditions.  We anticipate  this transaction will close during the second quarter.  \\nBerkshire Hathaway Primary Group  \\nPremiums earned in the first quarter by our various primary insurers were $ 426 million in 201 1 and $4 25 million in 20 10. \\nPremium volume of our primary insurers, in general, continues to be  constrained by soft market conditions. For the first quarter, ou r \\nprimary insurers produced underwriting gains of $56 million in 201 1 and $33 million in 20 10. The increase in underwriting gains in \\n2011 was primarily due to reductions of MedPro’s estimated prior years’ loss reserves , reflecting lower than expected claim  \\ndevelopment during 2011.  \\nInsurance —Investment Income  \\nA summary of net investment income of our insurance operations follows.

Investment income earned in \\n2011  was favorably impacted by increased dividend rates with respect to several of our common stock holdings , including  Wells \\nFargo and US Bancorp , as well as the accrual of dividends in connection with the redemption in April 2011 of our investment in \\nGoldman Sachs 10% P referred Stock. Investment income earned in the first quarter of 2011  was negatively impacted by the \\nredemption in the fourth quarter of 2010 of the CHF 3 billion 12% Swiss Re capital instrument.  We earned $8 5 million on this \\ninvestment in the first quarter of 2010. Our investment in General Electric 10% P referred Stock ($3 billion liquidation value) is \\nredeem able at General Electric’s option beginning in October 2011  and we currently expect that it will be redeemed  at that time . As a \\nresult of the redemptions to date (and those that may occur later in 2011), o ur investment income for the second quarter of 2011 (and \\nlikely beyond) will be negatively impacted , given the relatively low yields currently available from new investment opportuni ties.  \\nA summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses follows.

Float approximated $ 69 billion at March 31, 2011 and $66  billion at December  31, \\n2010. The cost  of float  for the first quarter , as represented by the ratio of our underwriting loss to average float, was about 2% in 2011 \\nand was negative in 2010, as our insurance businesses , in the aggregate, generated an underwriting gain.  \\nRailroad (“Burlington Nort hern Santa Fe”)  \\nWe acquired control of B urlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation including its subsidiary BNSF Railway Company, (“B NSF”)  \\non February 1 2, 2010 .

BNSF’s major business groups are classified by product shipped \\nand include consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products. The discussion that follows compares BNSF’s \\nresults for the three months ending March 31, 201 1 to the same three month period in 201 0.  \\nRevenues during the first three months of 2011 increased $ 669 million (17%) to $4.53 billion compared with $ 3.86 billion in the \\nprior year . Revenues include revenues from transportation services as well as revenues from  fuel surcharge programs intended to \\nrecover incremental fuel costs when fuel prices exceed threshold fuel price. The increase in revenues for the first quarter o f 2011 \\nreflected higher average revenues per car/unit in all four business groups as well as an 8% increase in cars/units handled. Average \\nrevenues per car/unit in 2011 included a 38% increase in fuel surcharges, which was driven by higher fuel prices, and increas ed rate \\nper car/unit. In 2011, c onsumer products revenues  increased due primarily to higher unit volumes within international and domestic \\nintermodal and automotive. Coal revenues  increased over 2010 primarily due to improved average revenues per car/unit . Industrial \\nproducts revenues increased primarily as a result of increased unit volume s, particularly  from higher shipments of  construction \\nproducts . Agricultural products revenues in 2011 increased  over 2010, reflecting increased wheat shipments.  '),\n",

MidAmerican’s domestic regulated energy interests are comprised of two regulated utility compa nies \\nand two interstate natural gas pipeline companies. In the United Kingdom, MidAmerican operates two electricity distribution \\nbusinesses. The rates that our utility and natural gas pipeline companies charge customers for energy and other services are generally \\nsubject to regulatory approval. Rates are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including a return on capital. To the extent these operations are not allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. In \\naddition, MidAmerican also operates a diversified portfolio of independent power projects and the second- largest residential real \\nestate brokerage firm in the United States. \\n \\nPacifiCorp’s revenues and earnings before corporate interest and income taxes (“EBIT”) in the first quarter of 2011 w ere \\nrelatively unchanged from the first quarter of 2010. Revenues in 2011 reflected higher retail revenues from higher prices app roved by \\nregulators and increased volume offset by lower wholesale revenues. The decline in wholesale revenues was attributable to a 36% \\ndecrease in average wholesale prices and a 21% decrease in wholesale volume. EBIT in 2011 reflected higher depreciation and \\noperating expenses which were offset by the modest increase in revenues and by lower energy costs. While the volume of energy \\nsupplied  in 2011 was relatively unchanged versus 2010, the overall cost declined. The decline in energy costs reflect ed the increased \\nuse of lower cost wind and hydroelectric generation and increased purchased electricity at lower average prices, which  together, \\nreplaced higher cost thermal generation.  \\nFirst quarter 2011 revenues of MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) declined $15 6 million (14%) from 2010. R egulated \\nelectricity revenues declined $52 million (primarily from lower wholesale volumes), regu lated natural gas operating revenues declined \\n$54 million (from lower prices and volumes) and non- regulated gas and electricity revenues declined $50 million (from lower prices \\nand volumes).  First quarter 2011 EBIT of MEC declined $12 million (14%)  from 2 010 as the decline in revenues was largely offset \\nby lower energy costs. In 2011, MEC incurred higher  maintenance costs resulting from an outage at its Louisa generation facility and \\ncomparatively lower maintenance costs associated with storms. Natural gas  pipelines revenues and EBIT in the first quarter of 2011 \\nwere relatively unchanged from the first quarter of 2010.  '),\n",

The increase in di stribution revenue s reflected \\nhigher rates which became effective in 2010 and regulatory revenue offsets accrued in 2010.  EBIT of U.K. utilities increased $67 \\nmillion (122%) from the first quarter of 2010 primarily as a result of the aforementioned increase in distribution revenues. The \\nfavorable impact of the rate changes and revenue offsets on comparative revenues and EBIT was more pronounced in the first quarter \\nand is expected to moderate over the remainder of the year.  \\nReal estate brokerage revenues i n the first quarter of 2011 decreased $13 million ( 6%) from 2010 due to decreases in closed \\nbrokerage units and average home sales prices.

Ten of Marmon’s eleven \\nbusiness sectors generated increased revenues compared to the first quarter of 2010.  The Building Wire, Flow Products and \\nDistribution Services sectors accounted for approximately 66% of the aggregate increase in reven ues. Approximately 40% of the \\nconsolidated revenue increase was attributable to the continuing increase in copper prices, which affected the Building Wire,  \\nEngineered Wire and Cable and Flow Products sectors. The increases in the cost of copper in these se ctors are passed on to customers \\nwith little or no margin. In the first quarter of 2011, all but two sectors (Retail Fixtures and Water Treatment) produced increased \\noperating earnings compared to the first quarter of 2010. The Distribution Services, Build ing Wire, Construction Services, \\nTransportation Services & Engineered Products and Highway Technologies sectors generated most of the dollar increase in earnings. \\nThe overall improvements in operating results reflected continued recoveries in many of Marmo n’s end markets and the ongoing \\neffort to reduce or maintain overhead costs  in light of the economic environment . \\nMcLane Company  \\nMcLane’s revenues for the first quarter of 2011 of $7,767 million increased $337 million (4.5%) over 2010, reflecting revenue \\nincreases from the grocery and foodservice business es and the impact of beverage distribution operations acquired in 2010. In 2010, \\nMcLane acquired Empire Distributors, based in Georgia and North Carolina and Horizon Wine and Spirits Inc., based in Tennessee. \\nEmpire and Horizon are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer.  \\nPre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2011 of $82 million w ere relatively unchanged from 2010. Pre -tax earnings in 2011 \\nreflected the inclusion of the acquired bev erage operations, offset by  a 41% increase in fuel and trucking costs of the grocery and food \\nservice businesses. McLane’s business is marked by high sales volume and very low profit margins and the fact that about 30% of its \\nannual revenues are from sales  to Wal- Mart. A curtailment of purchasing by Wal -Mart could have a material adverse impact on \\nMcLane’s earnings.  '),\n",

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  \\nManufacturing, Service and Ret ailing (Continued)  \\nOther manufacturing  \\nOur other manufacturing businesses include a wide array of businesses. Included in this group are several manufacturers of \\nbuilding products (Acme Building Brands, Benjamin Moore, Johns Manville, Shaw and MiTek) and apparel (led by Fruit of the Loom \\nwhich includes the Russell athletic apparel and sporting goods business and the Vanity Fair Brands women’s intimate apparel \\nbusiness). Also included in this group are Forest River, a leading manufacturer of leisure vehic les, ISCAR Metalworking Companies \\n(“IMC”), an industry leader in the metal cutting tools business with operations worldwide  and CTB, a manufacturer of equipment for \\nthe livestock and agricultural industries .  \\nRevenues from our other manufacturing activitie s for the first quarter of 2011 were $4,55 3 million, an increase of $4 76 million \\n(12%) over 2010. The increase in revenues reflected higher sales of apparel products (7%), building products ( 8%) and recreation \\nvehicles, metal cutting tools and systems for grain, poultry, egg and hog production (27% in the aggregate).  While revenues in 2011 \\nfrom the building products group increased over 2010, these businesses, generally, continue to be negatively impacted by slow  \\nconstruction activity, particularly in the s ingle -family housing markets.  \\nPre-tax earnings of our other manufacturing businesses in the first quarter of 2011 were $444 million, an increase of $112 \\nmillion (34%)  versus 2010. The improvement in earnings in 2011  was attributable to the increases in rev enues . In 2011, many of our \\nmanufacturers experienced higher commodity costs of certain raw materials (including cotton, steel and petrochemicals) as well as higher energy costs. As a result of t hese higher costs , in recent months we have increased selling  prices for certain products. To the \\nextent that costs continue to stay at current elevated levels or increase, further selling price actions will likely be neces sary.  \\nOther service \\n \\nOur other service businesses include NetJets, the world’s leading prov ider of fractional ownership programs for general aviation \\naircraft and FlightSafety, a provider of high technology training to operators of aircraft. Among the other businesses included in this group are: TTI, a leading electronic components distributor; Business Wire, a leading distributor of corporate news, multimedia and regulatory filings; The Pampered Chef, a direct seller of high quality kitchen tools; International Dairy Queen, a licensor a nd service \\nprovider to about 5, 900 stores that offer prepared dairy treats and food; The Buffalo News, a publisher of a daily and Sunday \\nnewspaper; and businesses that provide management and other services to insurance companies. \\n \\nRevenues of our other service businesses were $1,968 million in the first quarter of 2011, an increase of $194 million \\n(11%)  compared to 2010. Pre -tax earnings were $200 million in the first quarter of 2011, a decrease of $19 million (9%) versus 2010.  \\nThe increase in revenues included higher sales by TTI, FlightSafety and NetJets. The decline in earnings in 2011 reflected lower earnings at NetJets, partially offset by higher earnings of TTI and FlightSafety.  \\nThe improvements in revenues and earnings of FlightSafety and TTI reflected stronger customer demand. For the first quarter o f \\n2011,  NetJets’ earnings declined $55 million from 2010. The decrease was attributable to increased fees incurred to cancel certain \\naircraft purchases under a purchase agreement  entered into in 2006 and amended on June 6, 2008 and which committed NetJets to \\nunne eded aircraft , impairment charges related to the planned disposition of a block of aircraft later in 2011 and negative foreign \\ncurrency exchange rate movements affecting operations outside of the United States.  NetJets continues to own more aircraft t han \\nrequired for present operations and we expect to continue to dispose selected aircraft over time. NetJets’ operating cost str ucture has \\nbeen reduced to better match customer demand and we believe that NetJets will continue to operate profitably in the futu re. \\n \\nRetailing  \\nOur retailing operations consist of four home furnishings businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and \\nJordan’s), three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge) and See’s Candies. Revenues of our r etailing businesses \\nwere $687 million in the first quarter of 2011, a slight increase over 2010. First quarter 2011 revenues of the home furnishi ngs and \\njewelry businesses increased $1 9 million (3%) over 2010, while pre -tax earnings increased $3 million (1 7%). First quarter 2011 \\nrevenues and earnings of See’s Candies declined from 2010; the declines were attributable to the later Easter holiday in 2011 . '),\n",

Revenues from home sales in the first quarter of  2011  declined $87 million (24%) from 201 0, due to \\na 21% decrease in units sold and product mix changes. Unit sales in the first quarter of 2010 benefitted from the home buyer tax \\ncredit, which expired in the second quarter and, as a result, demand has sin ce declined. In the first quarter of 2011, financial services \\nincome also declined slightly from 2010, due primarily to lower interest income from installment loans.  Installment loan and  finance \\nreceivable balances were approximately $13.5 billion , a decr ease of approximately $200 million from December 31, 2010.  \\nThe operating results of Clayton Homes continue to be negatively affected by the soft housing markets and the surplus of \\ntraditional single family homes for sale. In addition, our manufactured hou sing programs have been at a competitive disadvantage \\ncompared to traditional single family housing markets, which have been receiving significant interest rate subsidies from the  U.S. \\ngovernment through government agency insured mortgages. For the most pa rt, these subsidies are not available to factory built homes. \\nNevertheless, Clayton Homes remains the largest manufactured housing business in the United States and we believe that it wil l \\ncontinue to operate profitably, even under the current conditions.  \\nBoth r evenues and pre- tax earnings from our furniture and transportation equipment leasing activities in 2011 increased $19 \\nmillion , compared to 2010. The increases primarily reflect ed higher transportation equipment rental income primarily due to increas ed \\nequipment utilization rates and lower depreciation expense.  \\nEarnings from our other finance business activities consists primarily of investment income from a portfolio of fixed maturit y \\nand equity investments and from a small portfolio of long -held co mmercial real estate loans. In addition, other activities include \\nearnings from interest rate spreads charged to Clayton Homes on borrowings (approximately $11.5 billion as of March 31, 2011), \\nwhich are used in connection with Clayton Homes’ installment le nding activities. A corresponding charge is reflected in Clayton \\nHomes’ earnings.  '),\n",

Investment \\ngains/losses for the first quarter of 2010 also included a one -time holding gain of $979 million in connection with our acquisition of \\nBNSF as a result of the application of acquisition accounting under GAAP.  \\nThe timing of gains or losses from sales can have a material effect on periodic earnings. Investment gains and losses usually  \\nhave minimal impact on our consolidated shareholders’ equ ity since most of the gains and losses are recorded at fair value in the \\nConsolidated Balance Sheets with the unrealized holding gains and losses included in shareholders’ equity as a component of \\naccumulated other comprehensive income as of each balance s heet date.  \\nWe believe the amount of investment gains/losses included in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive  \\nvalue.  Our decisions to sell securities are not motivated by the impact that the resulting gains or losses have on ou r reported earnings. \\nAlthough we do not consider investment gains and losses in a given period as necessarily meaningful or useful we are providin g \\ninformation to explain the nature of such gains and losses when they are reflected in earnings.  \\nOther -than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses  in the first quarter of 2011 related to our investments in Kraft Foods ($169  \\nmillion) and Wells Fargo ($ 337 million).   Such OTTI losses averaged about 7.5 % of the original cost of the impaired securities .  Most \\nof the i mpaired securities were in an unrealized loss position for more than two years. However, i n each case, the issuer has been \\nprofitable  and we expect that these businesses will continue to remain profitable . We also expect that the market prices for these \\nsecurities will eventually exceed our original cost . It should be noted that the OTTI losses related to Wells Fargo pertain to 103.6 \\nmillion  shares that had unrealized losses determined on a specific identification basis. We also held  255.4 million  shares of  Wells \\nFargo in which we had unrealized gains of approximately $ 3.7 billion as of March 31, 2011. However, none of these gains are \\nincluded in our past or current quarter earnings. This odd result occurs because existing accounting rules require that impai rments be \\nevaluated as to whether or not they are other  than temporary on an individual purchase lot basis since that is how we determine \\nrealized investment gains /losses  on sales of investments.  \\nThe OTTI losses recorded in the first quarter of 2011 had no  impact whatsoever on the asset values recorded in our \\nConsolidated Balance Sheets or o n our consolidated shareholders’ equity  as of March 31, 2011. Although we have periodically \\nrecorded OTTI losses in earnings  in the past , we continue to hold positions in many of these securities. The recognition of such losses \\nin earnings rather than in accumulated other comprehensive income does not necessarily indicate that sales are imminent or planned \\nand sales ultimately may not occur  for numerous years or even decades . Furthermore, the recognition of OTTI losses does not \\nnecessarily indicate that the loss in value of the security is permanent or that the market price of the security will not su bsequently \\nincrease to and ultimately exceed our original cost.  \\nWe consi der several factors in determining whether or not impairments are deemed to be other than temporary, including the \\ncurrent and expected long -term business prospects of the issuer, our ability and intent to hold the investment until the price recovers \\nand t he length of time and relative magnitude of the price decline.  Stock prices may remain below cost for a period of time  that may \\nbe deemed excessive from the standpoint of interpreting existing accounting rules  even though the other factors suggest that the stock \\nprices will eventually recover. As a result, accounting regulations may require that we recognize OTTI  losses in earnings  in instances  \\nwhere we may strongly believe that the market price  of the impaired security  will recover to at least our origina l cost and where we \\npossess the ability and intent to hold the security until, at least, that time.  \\nOn April 18, 2011, G oldman Sachs (“G S”) redeemed our entire investment in the 10% GS Preferred for $5.5 billion. Our second \\nquarter 2011 earnings will incl ude a pre- tax realized investment gain of $1.25 billion in connection with the redemption , representing \\nthe excess of the redemption proceeds over our cost. We carry the GS P referred at fair value and as of March 31, 2011, the value \\nreflected in our c onsol idated balance s heet was $5.5 billion.  As a result, our consolidated shareholders’ equity as of  \\n '),\n",

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  \\nInvestment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continue d) \\nMarch 31, 2011 already included a pre -tax unrealized gain of $1.25 billion as a component of accumulated other comprehensive \\nincome in connection with this investment. The realized investment gain that we will include in our second quarter earnings from  the \\nredemption will be entirely offset by a reversal of the unrealized gain  recorded as of March 31, 2011.  We anticipate our investment \\nincome for the second quarter of 2011 (and likely beyond) will decline compared with 2010 given the relatively low yields currently \\navailable from new investment opportunities. Otherwise, the redemption of the GS P referred will have essentially no impact on our \\nconsolidated comprehensive income for the second quarter of 2011 or our consolidated shareholders’ equity  as of June 30, 2011.  \\nDerivative gains/losses primarily represent the changes in fair value s of our credit default and equity index put option contracts. \\nPeriodic c hanges in the fair values of these contracts are reflected in earnings and can be significant, refl ecting the volatility of equity \\nand credit markets. Under many of the contracts, settlements will not occur until the contract expiration dates, many years from now. \\nOur derivative contracts generated gains of $ 271 million in the first quarter of 2011 and $411 million in the first quarter of 2010. Our \\nultimate payment obligations, if any, under our remaining equity index put option contracts will be determined as of the cont ract \\nexpiration dates, which begin in 2018.  \\nIn the first quarter of 2011, our equity  index put option contracts produced gains of $223 million, due primarily  to higher \\ninterest rate assumptions. In the first quarter of 2010, we recorded a gain of $178 million on equity index put  option contracts , which \\nreflected overall increases in the i ndex prices and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on contracts denominated in \\nforeign currencies partially offset by lower interest rate assumptions. Our credit default contracts generated gains of $ 70 million and \\n$208 million in the fir st quarters of 2011 and 2010, respectively. The gains in both periods were primarily due to narrowing of credit \\ndefault spreads for corporate issuers as well as the passage of time. There were no credit events affecting our contracts in the first \\nquarters of either 2011 or 2010.  \\nFinancial Condition  \\nOur balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Our consolidated shareholders’ equity  at \\nMarch  31, 2011 was $ 160.1 billion, an increase of $2 .7 billion  from December  31, 2010. Consolidated cash and investments of \\ninsurance and other businesses approximated $153. 2 billion at March 31, 2011 including cash and cash equivalents of $38 .4 billion. \\nThese assets are held predominantly in our insurance businesses. In February 20 11, we repaid $2.0 billion of Berkshire parent \\ncompany debt issued in connection with the BNSF acquisition.  In February 2012, an additional $1.7 billion of Berkshire paren t \\ncompany debt will mature.  In March 2011, we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding stock of The Lubrizol \\nCorporation for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $9.0 billion.  See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Stateme nts.  We \\nexpect that the acquisition will close in the third quarter of 2011 and plan to fund the acquisition price with existing cash and cash \\nequivalents.  \\nOur railroad, utilities and energy businesses conducted by MidAmerican and BNSF maintain very large investments in property, \\nplant and equipment and will regularly make significant ca pital expenditures in the normal course of business. In the first quarter of \\n2011, c apital expenditures by MidAmerican were approximately $ 551 million  and BNSF’s capital expenditures were approximately \\n$507 million. MidAmerican’s forecasted capital expendi tures for the remainder of 2011 are approximately $3. 1 billion. BNSF’s \\nforecasted capital expenditures for the remainder of 2011 are approximately $ 2.8 billion. Future capital expenditures are expected to \\nbe funded from cash flows from operations and debt proceeds. Aggregate borrowings of the railroad, utilities and energy businesses \\nwere about $31. 8 billion as of March 31, 2011, including $11 .9 billion of BNSF’s borrowings.  These businesses  have debt and capital \\nlease maturities over the remainder of  2011 of approximately $ 1.9 billion. Berkshire has committed until February  28, 2014 to provide \\nup to $2 billion of additional capital to MidAmerican to permit the repayment of its debt obligations or to fund its regulated utility  \\nsubsidiaries. Berkshire does no t guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, MidAmerican or any of their subsidiaries.  \\nAssets of the finance and financial products businesses, which consisted primarily of loans and finance receivables, fixed \\nmaturity securities, other investments  and cash and cash equivalents, were approximately $25. 1 billion as of March 31, 2011  and \\n$25.7 billion at December  31, 201 0. Liabilities were approximately $ 23.7 billion as of March 31, 2011 and $24.0  billion as of \\nDecember  31, 2010. As of March 31, 2011 , notes payable and other borrowings of $14. 4 billion included approximately $11.5 billion \\nof notes issued by BHFC. In January 2011, BHFC issued an additional $1.5 billion of notes and repaid $1.5 billion of maturing notes. \\nBHFC notes are unsecured and matu rities currently range from 2012  to 2040. In 2012, approximately $2.7 billion of BHFC’s debt will \\nmature, with most of the maturities occurring in the second and third quarters. The proceeds from the BHFC notes are used to finance \\noriginated and acquired l oans of Clayton Homes. The full and timely payment of principal and interest on the BHFC notes is \\nguaranteed by Berkshire.  \\nDuring 2008 and continuing into the first part of 2009, access to credit markets became limited as a consequence of a worldwi de \\ncredit crisis. However, management believes that the credit crisis has abated and as a result, interest rates for investment gr ade issuers \\nrelative to government obligations have declined. Nevertheless, restricted access to credit markets at affordable rates  in the future  \\n '),\n",

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  \\nFinancial Condition  (Continued)  \\ncould have a significant negative impact on our operations, particularly the railroad, utilities a nd energy and the finance and financial \\nproducts operations. On July  21, 2010, President Obama signed into law financial regulatory reform legislation, known as the Dodd-\\nFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Reform Act”). The Reform Act reshapes financial regulations in the \\nUnited States by creating new regulators, regulating new markets and firms and providing new enforcement powers to regulators . \\nVirtually all major areas of the Reform Act will be subject to regulatory interpretation and implementation rules requiring rulemaking that may take several years to complete. \\n \\nWe are party to several equity put option and credit default contracts as described in Note 1 2 to the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements. With limited exception, these c ontracts contain no collateral posting requirements under any circumstances, including \\nchanges in either the fair value or intrinsic value of the contracts or a downgrade in Berkshire’s credit ratings. Substantially all of these \\ncontracts were entered into  prior to December  31, 2008. At March 31, 2011, the net liabilities recorded for such contracts were \\napproximately $7.7 billion and our collateral posting requirements were $ 20 million. With respect to such collateral requirements, we \\nreceive the income at tributable to such collateral or, in certain instances, interest credit from the counterparty. Although the ultimate \\noutcome of the regulatory rulemaking proceedings described in the preceding paragraph cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not \\nbelieve  that the provisions of the Reform Act that concern collateral requirements apply to derivatives contracts that were entered i nto \\nprior to the enactment of the Reform Act, as ours were. As such, although the Reform Act may adversely affect some of our busi ness \\nactivities, it is not currently expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial results or financial condition.  \\nContractual Obligations  \\nWe are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which wi ll result in cash payments to \\ncounterparties in future periods. Certain obligations reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, require future \\npayments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. The tim ing and/or amount of the payment of other \\nobligations, such as losses arising from unpaid property and casualty loss insurance contracts and credit default and equity index put \\noption derivatives contracts, are contingent upon the outcome of future events.  Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps significantly, \\nfrom the liability estimates  currently recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet . Other obligations pertain to the acquisition of goods \\nor services in the future, which are not currently reflected in the financial statements, such as minimum rentals under operating leases. Our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2011 were not materially different from those disclosed in “Contractual Obligation s” \\nsection of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Berkshire’s \\nAnnual Report on Form 10- K for the year ended December  31, 2010.  \\nCritical Accounting Policies \\n \\nCertain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments regarding tra nsactions that have occurred and ultimately \\nwill be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized in the financial statements from such estimates are necessari ly based on \\nassumptions about numerous factors involving varying, and possibly signific ant, degrees of judgment and uncertainty. Accordingly, \\nthe amounts currently recorded in the financial statements may prove, with the benefit of hindsight, to be inaccurate. Refere nce is \\nmade to “Critical Accounting Policies” discussed in “Management’s Dis cussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of \\nOperations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10- K for the year ended December  31, 20 10 for additional discussion \\nregarding these estimates.  \\nOur Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2011 includes estimated liabilities for unpaid losses from property and casualty \\ninsurance and reinsurance contracts of $62 .4 billion. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the process of establishing loss reserve \\namounts, the actual ultimate claim amou nts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in \\nestimates of this magnitude will result in a material effect on reported earnings. The effects from changes in these estimate s are \\nrecorded as a component of loss es incurred in the period of the change.  \\nOur Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2011 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $49. 1 billion.  We evaluate \\ngoodwill for impairment at least annually and conducted our most recent annual review in th e fourth quarter of 2010. Such tests \\ninclude determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units. There are several methods of estimating a reporting uni t’s fair \\nvalue, including market quotations, underlying asset and liability fair value determi nations and other valuation techniques, such as \\ndiscounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. We primarily use discounted projected f uture \\nearnings or cash flow methods. The key assumptions and inputs used in such me thods may involve forecasting revenues and expenses, \\noperating cash flows and capital expenditures as well as an appropriate discount rate. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and performing goodwil l impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting \\ncash flows and earnings, actual future results may vary significantly from the forecasts. If the carrying amount of a reporti ng unit, \\nincluding goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, t hen individual assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities of \\nthe reporting unit are estimated at fair value. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimat ed fair value \\nof net assets would establish the  implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value is \\nthen charged to earnings as an impairment loss.\\n '),\n",

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  \\nCritical Accounting Policies (Continued)  \\nOur consolidated financial position reflects very significant amounts of invested assets and derivative contract liabilities that are \\nmeasured at fair value. While a  substantial portion of invested assets are carri ed at fair value based upon current market quotations and \\nother observable independent market inputs , values of certain assets are based upon fair value pricing matrices or models. Such assets \\ninclude certain private placement fixed maturity and equity sec urities and loans and finance receivables .  In addition, certain of our \\nderivative contract s are unique and there are, generally, no observable market prices for identical or sufficiently similar instruments. \\nAccordingly, we may use models in estimating th e values of such contracts. The models used in valuing such illiquid assets and \\nliabilities incorporate observable inputs as well as unobservable inputs, which require judgments by management.  Inputs used in \\ncertain valuation models  that are subject to ju dgment includ e interest rate, loan prepayment speed, duration, credit risk , expected \\nvolatilities, dividend rates  and liquidity risk assumptions. Changes in these assumptions may produce a significant effect on values. \\nFurthermore, accounting and reporting  standards are continually and rapidly changing in the area of financial instruments, which may \\nimpact the values recorded in the financial statements in future periods.  \\nInformation concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the Cons olidated Financial Statements.  \\nForward -Looking Statements  \\nInvestors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases \\nand some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentat ions about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward -looking” \\nstatements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward -looking statements \\ninclude statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upo n or refer to future events or conditions, which include words \\nsuch as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statem ents \\nconcerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or \\nprospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward -looking statements as \\ndefined by the Act. Forward -looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject \\nto risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guaranties of future performance and we have no specific intention to \\nupdate these statements. \\n \\nActual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward -looking statements due to a \\nnumber of factors. The principal  important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ \\nmaterially from such forward -looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed \\nmaturity and equit y securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an \\nearthquake, hurricane or act of terrorism that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries, changes in laws or regula tions \\naffect ing our insurance, railroad, utilities, energy and finance subsidiaries, changes in federal income tax laws, and changes in general \\neconomic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business.  \\nItem  3. Quant itative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  \\nReference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report and in particular the “Market Risk Disclosures” included \\nin “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result s of Operations.” As of March 31, 2011, there are no \\nmaterial changes in the market risks described in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10 -K for the year ended December  31, 2010.  \\nItem  4. Controls and Procedures  \\nAs of the end of the period covered by  this Quarterly Report on Form 10- Q, the Corporation carried out an evaluation, under the \\nsupervision and with the participation of the Corporation’s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the \\nSenior Vice President -Treasurer (Chie f Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation’s \\ndisclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a -15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive \\nOfficer) and the Senior Vice Pres ident -Treasurer (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Corporation’s disclosure controls and \\nprocedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Corporation (including its consolida ted \\nsubsidiaries) required to be  included in the Corporation’s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant \\nchanges in the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect in ternal control \\nover financi al reporting.

Legal Proceedings  \\nWe are party in a variety of legal actions arising out of the normal course of business. In particular, such legal actions af fect our \\ninsurance and reinsurance businesses. Such litigation generally seeks to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or \\nindirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary  damages. \\nWe do not believe that such normal a nd routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. \\nReference is made to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10- K for the year \\nended December 31, 2010 for  detailed discussion of such actions.  \\nItem  1A.

For citations, monetary penalties are assessed by MS HA. Citations, \\nnotices and orders can be contested and appealed and the severity and assessment of penalties may be reduced or, in some case s, \\ndismissed through the appeal process.  \\nThe table below summarizes the total number of citations, notices and orders issued and penalties assessed by MSHA for each \\ncoal mine or coal processing facility operated by PacifiCorp under the indicated provisions of the Mine Safety Act during the three -\\nmonth period ended March 31, 2011 . Legal actions pending before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, which is \\nnot exclusive to citations, notices, orders and penalties assessed by MSHA, are as of March 31, 2011.

General  \\nThe accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire” \\nor “Company”) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire h olds controlling financial \\ninterest s as of the financial statement date. In these notes the terms “us,” “we,” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated \\nsubsidiaries.  Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10 -K (“Annual Report”) that included \\ninformation necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire’s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant \\naccounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statement s included in the Annual Report. \\nCertain immaterial amounts in 20 11 have been reclassified  to conform to the current year presentation. Financial information in this \\nReport reflects any adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are , in the opinion of management, necessary to \\na fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United  States \\n(“GAAP”).  \\nFor a number of reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The \\ntiming and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of \\ndetermining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidi aries can be relatively more significant to results of interim periods than to \\nresults for a full year. Variations in the amount and timing of investment gains/losses can cause significant variations in p eriodic net \\nearnings. Investment gains/losses are recorded when investments are disposed or are other -than- temporarily impaired . In addition, \\nchanges in the fair value of derivative assets/liabilities associated with derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedging \\ninstruments can cause significan t variations in periodic net earnings.  \\nNote 2.     New accounting pronouncements  \\nAs of January 1, 2012, we adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2010- 26, “Accounting for Costs Associated \\nwith Acquiring or Renewing Insurance Contracts.” ASU 2010- 26 specifies that only direct incremental costs associated with \\nsuccessful efforts in acquiring or renewing of insurance contracts should be capitalized and amortized over the policy term. All other costs are required to  be expensed as incurred. Capit alized costs include certain advertising costs if the primary purpose of the \\nadvertising is to elicit sales to customers who could be shown to have responded directly to the advertising and the probable  future \\nrevenues generated from the advertising are in  excess of expected future costs to be incurred in realizing those revenues. Berkshire is \\nadopting ASU 2010- 26 on a prospective basis. The impact of the adoption of this new standard primarily relates to certain advertising \\ncosts of GEICO, which  were capit alized  prior to the adoption of ASU 2010- 26, but are no longer eligible to be capitalized.  The \\nadoption of this new standard did not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\nAs of January 1, 2012, we also adopted ASU 2011- 04, “Amend ments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and \\nDisclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs .” As a result of adopting ASU 2011- 04, we have expanded our fair value \\ndisclosures.  \\nIn December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011- 11 “Disclosures about Offsetti ng Assets and Liabilities.” ASU 2011 -11 \\nenhances disclosures surrounding offsetting (netting) assets and liabilities. The standard applies to financial instruments a nd \\nderivatives and requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about inst ruments and transactions eligible for offset in \\nfinancial statements and instruments and transactions subject to a master netting arrangement. ASU 2011- 11 is effective \\nretrospectively for Berkshire beginning January  1, 2013. We are currently evaluating the effect this standard will have on our \\nConsolidated Financial Statements.  \\nNote 3.    Significant business acquisitions  \\nOur long- held acquisition strategy is to purchase businesses with consistent earning power, good returns on equity and able and \\nhonest management at sensible prices. \\n \\nOn September 16, 2011, Berkshire completed the acquisition of The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”). The acquisition was \\npursuant to a merger agreement, whereby Berkshire agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Lubrizol common stock for cash \\nof $135 per share (approximately $8.7 billion in the aggregate). Lubrizol, based in Cleveland, Ohio, is an innovative special ty \\nchemical company that produces and supplies technologies to customers in the global transportatio n, industrial and consumer markets. \\nThese technologies include additives for engine oils, other transportation -related fluids and industrial lubricants, as well as additives \\nfor gasoline and diesel fuel. In addition, Lubrizol makes ingredients and additive s for personal care products and pharmaceuticals; \\nspecialty materials, including plastics; and performance coatings. Lubrizol’s industry -leading technologies in additives, ingredients \\nand compounds enhance the quality, performance and value of customers’ p roducts, while reducing their environmental impact. \\nLubrizol’s financial results were included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning as of September  16, 2011.

OTTI losses recognized in earnings represent reductions in the \\ncost basis of the investment, but not the fair value. Accordingly, such losses that are included in earnings are generally of fset by a \\ncorresp onding credit to other comprehensive income and therefore have no net effect on shareholders’ equity.  \\nIn the first quarter of 2012, we recorded OTTI losses of $337 million on certain fixed maturity investments where we concluded \\nthat we were unlikely to r eceive all of the remaining contractual interest and principal amounts when due. A ll of these losses were \\nattributable to a single issuer.  In the first quarter of 2011, we recorded OTTI losses of $506 million related to certain of our \\ninvestments in equi ty securities. The OTTI losses included $337 million with respect to 103.6 million shares of our investment in \\nWells Fargo  & Company (“Wells Fargo”) common stock. These shares had an aggregate original cost of $3,621 million. At that time, \\nwe also held an additional 255.4 million shares of Wells Fargo which were acquired at an aggregate cost of $4,394 million  and had \\nunrealized gain s of $3,704 million as of March  31, 2011. Due to the length of time that certain of our Wells Fargo shares were in a \\ncontinuous  unrealized loss position and because we account for gains and losses on a specific identification basis, accounting \\nregulations required us to record the unrealized losses in earnings. However, the unrealized gains were not reflected in earn ings but \\nwere instead recorded directly in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.  \\nNote 8.

Derivative contracts (Continued)  \\nThe high yield index contracts are comprised of specified North American corporate issuers (usually 100 in number at \\ninception) whose obligations are rated below investment gra de. High yield contracts in -force at March  31, 2012 expire in 2012 and \\n2013. State and municipality contracts are comprised of over 500 state and municipality issuers and had a remaining weighted average \\ncontract life at March  31, 2012 of approximately 9. 0 years. Loss payments, if any,  related to approximately 50% of the notional value \\nof the state and municipality contracts cannot be settled before the maturity dates of the underlying municipality obligation , which \\nrange from 2019 to 2054.  \\nPremiums on t he high yield index and state/municipality contracts were received in full at the inception dates of the contracts \\nand, as a result, we have no counterparty credit risk. Our payment obligations under certain of these contracts are on a firs t loss basis. \\nLosses under other contracts are subject to aggregate deductibles that must be satisfied before we have any payment obligations .  \\nIndividual corporate credit default contracts primarily relate to issuers of investment grade obligations. In most instances,  \\npremiums are due from counterparties on a quarterly basis over the terms of the contracts. As of March  31, 2012, all of the remaining \\ncontracts in -force will expire in 2013.  \\nWith limited exceptions, our equity index put option and credit default contrac ts contain no collateral posting requirements with \\nrespect to changes in either the fair value or intrinsic value of the contracts and/or a downgrade of Berkshire’s credit rati ngs. As of \\nMarch  31, 2012, our collateral posting requirement under contracts wi th collateral provisions was $ 45 million compared to \\n$238 million at December  31, 2011. If Berkshire’s credit ratings (currently AA+ from Standard  & Poor’s and Aa2 from Moody’s) are \\ndowngraded below either A - by Standard  & Poor’s or A3 by Moody’s, addition al collateral of up to $1.1 billion could be required to \\nbe posted.  \\nOur regulated utility subsidiaries are exposed to variations in the market prices in the purchases and sales of natural gas and \\nelectricity and in the purchases of fuel. Derivative instruments, including forward purchases and sales, futures, swaps and options, are \\nused to manage these price risks. Unrealized gains and losses under the contracts of our regulated utilities that are probabl e of \\nrecovery through rates are recorded as regulat ory asset s or liabilities . Unrealized gains or losses on contracts accounted for as cash \\nflow or fair value hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or in net earnings, as appropriate. Derivative \\ncontract assets included in other asset s of railroad, utilities and energy businesses were $ 61 million and $ 71 million as of March 31, \\n2012 and December  31, 2011, respectively.

Unless otherwise required under Delaware General \\nCorporation Law, Class  A and Class B common shares vote as a single class.

Berkshire may \\nrepurchase shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, at management’s discretion. Berkshire’s Board of \\nDirectors’ authorization does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if \\nthey would reduce Berkshire’s consolidated cash equivalent holdings below $20 billion. The repurchase program is expected to continue indefinitely and the amount of repurchases will depend entirely upon the level of cash available, the attractiveness  of \\ninvestment and business opportunities either at hand or on the horizon and the d egree of discount of the market price relative to \\nmanagement’s estimate of intrinsic value. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any dollar amount or number of Class  A or Class B shares.  \\nNote 1 6.

Fair value measurements  (Continued)  \\nFair values for substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using ma rket or income approaches. Considerable \\njudgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented \\nherein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in an  actual current market exchange. The use of different \\nmarket assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value.  \\nThe hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3.  \\nLevel 1  – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Substantially \\nall of our investments in equity securities are traded on an exchange in active markets and fair values are based on the clos ing \\nprices as of the balance sheet date.  \\nLevel 2  – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar \\nassets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical ass ets or liabilities exchanged in inactive \\nmarkets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and def ault rates; and inputs that are derived principally \\nfrom or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Fair values of  investments in fixed maturity \\nsecurities and notes payable and other borrowings are primarily based on price ev aluations which incorporate market prices for \\nidentical instruments in inactive markets and market data available for instruments with similar characteristics. Pricing \\nevaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate y ield curves for instruments with similar \\ncharacteristics, such as credit rating, estimated duration and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same \\nindustry sector. \\n \\nLevel 3  – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the meas urement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its \\nown assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities o r related \\nobservable inputs that can be corroborated at the measurement date. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain \\nprojections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in pricing assets or liabilities.  \\nMeasurements of non -exchange traded derivative contracts an d certain other investments carried at fair value are based \\nprimarily on valuation models, discounted cash flow models or other valuation techniques that are believed to be used by mark et \\nparticipants.  \\nFinancial instruments  measured at fair value on a r ecurring basis are summarized, according to the hierarchy previously \\ndescribed, as follows (in  millions).  \\n     \\n  Total \\nFair Value  \\n  Quoted  \\nPrices  \\n(Level 1)   \\n  Significant  Other  \\nObservable  Inputs  \\n(Level 2)   \\n  Significant  \\nUnobservable  Inputs  \\n(Level 3)   \\n  \\nMarch  31, 2012          \\nInvestments in fixed maturity securities:          \\nU.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and \\nagencies  ................................................................ ........   $ 2,652  $ 1,022   $ 1,628  $ 2  \\nStates, municipalities and political subdivisions  ...............    2,951   —   2,950   1  \\nForeign  governments  ................................ ........................    10,991   4,582   6,409   —  \\nCorporate bonds  ................................ ................................    12,297   —   11,645   652  \\nMortgage -backed securities  ................................ ..............    2,807   —   2,807   —  \\nInvestments in equity securities  ................................ ..................    89,115   89,018   65   32  \\nOther investments  ................................ ................................ .......   14,158   —   —   14,158  \\nLoan s and finance receivables (1) ................................ ................    13,016    —   1,019    11,997   \\n     \\nNotes payable and other borrowings (1):     \\nInsurance and other  ................................ ..........................    14,186    —   14,186    —  \\nRailroad, utilities and energy ................................ ............    38,697    —   38,697    —  \\nFinance and financial  products  ................................ ........    14,549   —   13,667    882  \\nNet derivative contract (assets)/liabilities:              \\nRailroad, utilities and energy  ................................ ............    411   31   405   (25) \\nFinance and financial products:          \\nEquity index put options ................................ ..........    7,810   —   —   7,810   \\nCredit default obligat ions ................................ ........    1,086   —   —   1,086  \\nOther  ................................ ................................ ........

Fair value measurements  (Continued)   \\nAs of March  31, 2011, we transferred our investment in GS Preferred to Level 2 given the then pending redemption of that \\ninvestment which occurred on April  18, 2011. There were no transfers into Level 3 f or the  first quarter of 2012 or 2011.  Gains and \\nlosses included in net earnings are included as components of investment gains/losses, derivative gains/losses and other revenues, as \\nappropriate  and are related to changes in valuations of derivative cont racts and disposal or settlement transactions.  Gains and losses \\nincluded in other comprehensive income are included as components of net change in unrealized appreciation of investments and  \\nreclassification of investment appreciation in earnings, as approp riate in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.  \\nQuantitative information as of March 31, 2012,  with respect to assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a \\nrecurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs ( Level 3) follow s (in millions).  \\n     \\n  Fair value  \\n  Principal valuation  \\ntechniques   \\n  Unobservable Input   \\n  Weighted \\nAverage  \\n  \\nOther investments:      \\nPreferred stocks  ................................ ...    $11,307  Discounted cash flow  Expected duration  10 years  \\n  \\n Discount for transferab ility \\nrestrictions and subordination  97 Bps  \\n     \\nCommon stock warrants  ......................    2,851   Warrant pricing model  Discount for transferability \\nand hedging restrictions  18% \\nNet derivative liabilities:      \\nEquity index put options  ......................    7,810   Option pricing model  Volat ility 22% \\n     \\nCredit default -states/ municipal ities .....    1,025   Discounted cash flow  Credit default spreads  120 Bps  \\nFor certain credit default and other derivative contracts  where we could not corroborate that the fair values or the inputs were \\nobservable in the market , fair values were based on non -binding price  indication s obtained from third party sources . Management \\nreviewed these values relative to the terms of the contracts and concluded they were reasonable. We did not adjust these prices and therefo re, they have been excluded from the preceding table.  \\nOur other investments consist of a few relatively large private placement transactions and include perpetual preferred stock and \\ncommon stock warrants. These investments are subject to contractual restr ictions on transferability and/or provisions that prevent us \\neconomically from hedging our investments.  In applying discounted estimated cash flow techniques in valuing the perpetual preferred \\nstocks, we made assumptions regarding the expected durations o f the investments, as the issuers have the right to redeem these \\ninvestments. We also ma de estimates regarding the impact of subordination, as the preferred stock has a lower priority in liquidation \\nthan the investment grade debt instruments of the issuer s, which affected the discount rates.  In valuing the common stock warrants, we \\nused a warrant valuation model.  While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we are subject to the aforementioned contractual restrictions. We have applied discounts wi th respect to the contractual restrictions. Increases  or decreases to these inputs \\nwould result in decreases  or increases to the fair values.  \\nOur equity index put option and credit default contracts are not exchange traded and certain contract terms are n ot standard in \\nderivatives markets. For example, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts and many contracts have long \\ndurations , and therefore are illiquid. For these and other reasons, we classified these contracts as Level 3. T he methods we use to value \\nthese contracts are those that we believe market participants would use in determining exchange prices with respect to our contracts .  \\nWe value equity index put option contracts based on the Black -Scholes option valuation model. Inputs to this model include \\ncurrent index price, contract duration, dividend and interest rate inputs (which include a Berkshire performance input) which  are \\nobservable. However, the valuation of long -duration options is inherently subjective, given the l ack of observable transactions and \\nprices, and acceptable values may be subject to wide ranges. Expected volatility inputs represent our expectations after cons idering the \\nremaining duration of each contract and that the contracts will remain outstanding u ntil the expiration dates without offsetting \\ntransactions occurring in the interim. Increases  or decreases in the volatility inputs will produce increases  or decreases in the fair \\nvalues.  \\nOur state and municipality credit default contract  values reflect  credit default spreads, contract durations, interest rates , bond \\nprices  and other inputs believed to be used by market participants in estimating fair value. We utilize discounted cash flow valuation \\nmodels, which incorporate the aforementioned inputs as wel l as our own estimates of credit default spreads for states and \\nmunicipalities where there is no observable input.  Increases  or decreases to the credit default spreads will produce increases  or \\ndecreases in the fair values.  '),\n",

Our operating businesses are managed on an \\nunusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, \\npurchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day- to-day business \\nactivities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for \\nsignificant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operati ng \\nbusinesses. It also is responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire’s corporate governance efforts, including, but n ot limited \\nto, communicating the appropriate “tone at the top” messages to its employees and associates, monitoring governance efforts at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance -related issues as needed. The business segment data (Note 17 \\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. We completed the acquisition of The \\nLubrizol Corporation on September  16, 2011 and its results are included for the first quarter of 2012 as a component of \\nmanufacturing, service and retailing businesses in the preceding table.  \\nDuring the first quarter of 2011, insuran ce underwriting results of our reinsurance operations included after -tax losses of \\napproximately $1.1 billion from several significant catastrophe events. We incurred no significant losses from catastrophes d uring the \\nfirst quarter of 2012.\\n \\nInvestment and derivative gains /losses in the first quarter included after -tax gains from derivative contracts of $650 million in \\n2012 and $176 million in 2011. Investment and derivative gains/ losses in the first quarter also included after -tax other -than-temporary \\nimpai rment (“OTTI”) losses of $ 219 million in 2012 and $322 million in 2011.  In 2012, the OTTI losses related to fixed maturity \\ninvestments in a single issuer where we concluded that we are unlikely to receive all contractual cash flows when due. In 2011, the \\nOTTI losses related to certain equity securities. We believe that realized investment gains/losses and OTTI losses are often \\nmeaningless in terms of understanding our reported results or evaluating our economic performance.  These gains and losses an d \\nchan ges in the equity and credit markets from period to period have caused and will likely continue to cause significant volatili ty in \\nour periodic earnings.  \\nInsurance —Underwriting  \\nWe engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property and casual ty risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume \\ndefined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance ac tivities, we \\nassume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other  insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own \\ninsuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are: (1)  GEICO, (2) General Re, (3)  Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance \\nGroup (“BHRG”) and (4) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Gene ral Re and BHRG also reinsure life and health risks.  \\nOur management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations –  underwriting and investing. Underwriting \\ndecisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing  decisions , with  limited exceptions, are the responsibility of Berkshire’s \\nChairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett. Accordingly, we evaluate the performance of underwriting operations without any allocation \\nof investment income.  '),\n",

Management’s Discussion and Analysi s of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  \\nInsurance —Underwriting  (Continued)  \\nOur periodic underwriting results are affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment \\nexpenses, including amounts establi shed for occurrences in prior years. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce \\nsignificant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to BHRG and General Re. We incurred no  \\nsignificant losses from catastrophes occurring in the first quarter of 2012. In the first quarter of 2011, we recorded aggregate estimated \\npre-tax losses of approximately $1.7 billion arising from several catastrophe events, including the earthquakes in Japan and New \\nZealand, as well as a cyclone and floods in Australia.  Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency \\ntransaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation s of certain non -U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities \\nas a resul t of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  \\nA key marketing strategy followed by all of our insurance businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength. \\nStatutory surplus of our insurance businesses was approximately $95 billion at Dece mber  31, 2011. This superior capital strength \\ncreates opportunities, especially with respect to reinsurance activities, to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsuran ce contracts \\nspecially designed to meet the unique needs of insurance and reinsurance buyers.  \\nA summary follows of underwriting results from our insurance businesses.

The loss ra tio (the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned) \\nwas 73.0% in the first quarter of 2012 compared to 72.2% in 2011. The increase in the loss ratio in the first quarter of 2012 reflected \\nhigher average injury and physical da mage severities estimates. In the first quarter of 2012, bodily injury severities estimates generally \\nincreased in the one to two percent range over 2011, while physical damage severities increased in the six to nine percent range.

Management ’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  \\nInsurance —Underwriting (Continued)  \\nGEICO (Continued)  \\nUnderwriting expenses in the first quarter of 2012 were $959 million, an increase  of $274 million (40.0%) over 2 011. The \\nincrease was primarily the result of a change in U.S. GAAP accounting standards regarding deferred policy acquisition costs \\n(“DPAC”), which represent certain underwriting costs that are eligible to b e capitalized and expensed over the policy perio d as the \\nrelated premiums are earned. As a result of adopting the new accounting standard, beginning in 2012, GEICO ceased deferring a large portion of its direct advertising cost. Through prospective adoption of the new accounting standard, DPAC as of Dec ember 31, 2011 \\nwill be amortized to expense over the remainder of the related policy periods. Acquisition costs related to policies written and renewed after December 31, 2011 will be deferred at lower levels than in the past. The new accounting standard f or DPAC does not impact the \\ncash basis underwriting costs or our assessment of GEICO’s underwriting performance. However, the new standard accelerates th e \\ntiming of when underwriting costs are recognized in earnings.  \\nWe estimate that GEICO’s underwriting expenses for the first quarter of 2012 would have been about $250 million less had we \\ncomputed DPAC under the prior standard  and that its expense ratio in 2012 would have been less than 2011. We anticipate that \\nsubstantially all the effect of transitioning to this new standard will be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2012. Thereafter, \\nwe expect that the amount of GEICO underwriting expenses reported in earnings will decline to near the historical levels as measured \\nby the ratio of underwriting expenses to premiums earned.  \\nGeneral Re \\n \\nThrough General Re, we conduct a reinsurance business offering property and casualty and life and health coverages to clients  \\nworldwide. We write property and casualty reinsurance in North America on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation and internationally through Germany- based General Reinsurance AG and other wholly -owned affiliates. Property and casualty \\nreinsurance is also written through brokers with respect to Faraday in London. Life and he alth reinsurance is written in North America \\nthrough General Re Life Corporation and internationally through General Reinsurance AG. General Re strives to generate underwriting profits in essentially all of its product lines . Our management does not evalua te underwriting performance based upon \\nmarket share and our underwriters are instructed to reject  inadequately priced risks. General Re’s underwriting results are summarized \\nin the following table. Amounts are in  millions.  \\n     \\n  First Quarter   \\n  \\n  Premiums earned   \\n  Pre-tax underwriting  gain (loss)  \\n  \\n  2012  \\n  2011  \\n  2012  \\n  2011  \\n  \\nProperty/casualty  ................................ ................................ ...............   $ 735  $ 715  $ 46  $ (324) \\nLife/health  ................................ ................................ ..........................    736   722   35   (2) \\n        $1,471   $1,437   $ 81  $ (326) \\n      \\nProperty/casualty  \\nProperty/ca sualty premiums earned in the first quarter of 2012 were $735 million, an increase of $20 million (2.8%) compared \\nto 2011. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums earned in the first quarter of 2012 increased $31 \\nmillion ( 4.3%), which was primarily due to increases in i nternational treaty business.  Price competition in most property and casualty \\nlines persists. Our underwriters continue to exercise discipline by not accepting offers to write business where prices are d eemed \\ninadequate. We remain prepared to increase premium volumes should market conditions improve.  \\nUnderwriting results in the first quarter of 2012 included underwriting gain s of $66 million from property business, offset in part \\nby underwriting losses of $20 million from casualty/workers’ compensation business. The property underwriting gain s reflect an \\nabsence of significant catastrophe losses as well as underwriting gains from the run -off of prior years’ business. The timing and \\nmagnitude of catastrophe an d large individual losses has produced and is expected to continue to produce significant volatility in \\nperiodic underwriting results.  The underwriting losses from casualty/workers’ compensation business included $ 26 million from loss \\nreserve discount accretion and deferred charge amortization.  \\nUnderwriting losses in the first quarter of 2011 consisted of  $355 million of losses from property business offset in part by \\nunderwriting gains of $31 million from casualty/workers’ compensation businesses. The p roperty results included $491 million of \\ncatastrophe losses incurred, which were primarily from the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand.  The underwriting gains of $31 \\nmillion from casualty/workers’ compensation business reflected overall favorable run -off of prior years’ casualty loss reserves.  '),\n",

Adjusting for the \\neffects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums earned increased 4.1% over the first quarter of 2011. The increas e in \\npremiums earned was primarily  due to increased non -U.S. life business. The life/health operations produced an underwriting gain of \\n$35 million in 2012 as compared to an underwriting loss of $2 million in 2011.  The first quarter of 2012 underwriting gain was \\nprimarily due to lower tha n expected mortality. The loss in the first quarter of 2011 included $40 million of incurred losses related to \\nthe earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand and also reflected increases in frequency and severity of life and health claims in the U.S.  \\nBerkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”)  \\nThrough BHRG, we underwrite excess -of-loss reinsurance and quota -share coverages on property and casualty risks for insurers \\nand reinsurers worldwide. BHRG’s business includes catastrophe excess -of-loss reinsurance and excess primary and facultative \\nreinsurance for large or otherwise unusual property risks referred to as individual risk. BHRG also writes retroactive reinsu rance, \\nwhich provides indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events. Other multi -line business \\nrefers to other property and casualty business written on both a quota -share and excess basis and includes a quota -share contract with \\nSwiss Reinsurance Company Ltd. (“Swiss Re”) covering a 20% share of substantially al l of Swiss Re’s property/casualty contracts  \\nincepting between January  1, 2008 and December  31, 2012. We currently do not anticipate that the Swiss Re quota- share contract will \\nbe renewed or extended. BHRG’s underwriting activities also include life reinsur ance and annuity business. BHRG’s underwriting \\nresults are summarized in the table below. Amounts are in millions.  \\n     \\n  First Quarter   \\n  \\n  Premiums earned   \\n  Pre-tax underwriting  gain (loss)  \\n  \\n  2012  \\n  2011  \\n  2012  \\n  2011  \\n  Catastrophe and indi vidual risk ................................ ........................   $ 134  $ 189  $ 82  $ (273) \\nRetroactive reinsurance  ................................ ................................ ....    298   143   (73)  (155) \\nOther multi -line property/casualty  ................................ ...................    1,125    1,133    (130)  (910) \\nLife and annuity  ................................ ................................ ...............    514   479   (70)  (5) \\n        $ 2,071   $ 1,944   $ (191) $(1,343 ) \\n      \\nPremiums earned in the first quarter of 2012 from catastrophe and individual risk contracts declined  $55 million ( 29%)  versus  \\nthe first quarter of 2011. The level of business written in a given period will vary significantly due to changes in market  conditions and \\nmanagement’s assessment of the adequacy of premium rates. We have generally constrained the volume of business written in recent \\nyears as premium rates have not been attractive enough to warrant increasing volume.  However, we have the capacity and willingness \\nto write substantially more business when appropriate pricing can be obtained.   \\nCatastrophe and individual risk underwriting results for the first quarter of 2012 reflected no significant losses from catastrophe \\nevents , while results for the first quarter of 2011 included estimated losses of $454 million from the earthquake s in Japan and New \\nZealand.  Catastrophe and individual risk contracts may provide exceptionally large limits of indemnification and cover catas trophe \\nrisks (such as  hurricanes, earthquakes or other natural disasters) or other property and liability risks. The timing and magnitude of \\nlosses produces extraordinary volatility in periodic underwriting results of this business.  \\nRetroactive reinsurance policies generally provide very large, but limited, indemnification of losses and loss adjustment \\nexpenses with respect to past loss events that are generally expected to be paid over long periods of time. Underwriting resu lts \\nattributable to retroactive reinsurance include the recurring periodic amortization of deferred charges that are established with respect \\nto these contracts. At the inception of a contract, deferred charges represent the difference between the premium received an d the \\nestimated ultimate losses payable. Deferred charges are subsequently amortized over the estimated claims payment period using the interest method , which reflects estimates of the timing and amount of loss payments. The original estimates of the timing and amount \\nof loss payments are analyze d against actual experience and as  necessary are revised based on an actuarial evaluation of the expected \\nremaining losses. Amortization charges and deferred charge adjustments resulting from changes to the estimated timing and amo unt of \\nfuture loss paymen ts are included as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  \\nInsurance —Underwriting (Continued)  \\nBerkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group  (“BHR G”) (Continued)  \\nThe underwriting losses from retroactive policies for the first quarter of 2012 and 2011 primarily represent the amortization  of \\ndeferred charges. At March 31, 2012 and December  31, 2011, unamortized deferred charges for all of BHRG’s retroactive contracts \\nwere approximately $ 3.9 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. Gross unpaid losses from retroactive reinsurance contracts were \\napproximately $18. 6 billion at March 31, 2012 compared to approximately $18. 8 billion as of December  31, 2011.   \\nPremiums earned in the first quarter s of 2012 and 2011 from other multi -line property and casualty business included $74 6 \\nmillion and $785 million, respectively, from the Swiss Re quota -share contract. Other multi -line property and casualty underwriting \\nlosses in the first quarter s of 2012 and 2011 were $130 million and $910 million, respectively. Underwriting results can be \\nsignificantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses (arising primarily from the Swiss Re quota -share contract) \\nand fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. While there were no significant catastrophe loss  events  in 2012, we increased \\nliability estimates for prior years’ losses by approximately $53 million.  U nderwriting results in the first quarter of 2011 i ncluded \\nestimated catastrophe losses of $701 million  from the Swiss Re quota -share contract . Other m ulti-line property and casualty \\nunderwriting results also included losses of $1 35 million  in the first quarter of 2012 and $173 million in the first quarter  of 2011 \\narising from the conversion of certain reinsurance liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  into U.S. Dollars .  \\nLife and annuity premiums earned in the first quarters of 2012 and 2011 primarily derive from life  reinsurance contract s, \\nincludin g a contract with  Swiss Re Life  & Health America Inc. covering yearly renewable term risks.  Underwriting losses of the life \\nand annuity business were $ 70 million  for the first quarter of 2012 and $5 million for the first quarter of 2011. For the first quar ter, the \\nlife reinsurance business produced an  underwriting loss of $21 million in 2012 compared to a n underwriting gain of $16 million in \\n2011.  The underwriting results of the life and annuity business also include underwriting losses related to a portfol io of annuity \\ncontracts, most of which were written several years ago. For the first quarter, the annuity business generated underwriting losses of \\n$49 million in 2012 and $2 1 million in 2011. The increase in annuity underwriting losses in 2012 was primari ly attributable to \\nunfavorable foreign currency exchange rate changes  and lower mortality gains .  At March 31, 2012 and December  31, 2011, annuity \\nliabilities were approximately $ 2.15 billion and $2. 07 billion, respectively.   \\nBerkshire Hathaway Primary G roup  \\nOur primary insurance group consists of a wide variety of independently managed insurance businesses that principally write \\nliability coverages for commercial accounts. These businesses include: Medical Protective Corporation and Princeton Insurance  \\nCompany (acquired as of December  30, 2011), providers of professional liability insurance to physicians, dentists and other healthcare \\nproviders; National Indemnity Company’s primary group, writers of commercial motor vehicle and general liability coverage s; U.S. \\nInvestment Corporation, whose subsidiaries underwrite specialty insurance coverages; a group of companies referred to internally as \\n“Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies,” providers of commercial multi -line insurance , including workers’ compensat ion; \\nCentral States Indemnity Company, a provider of credit and disability insurance to individuals nationwide through financial institutions; Applied Underwriters, a provider of integrated workers’ compensation solutions; and BoatU.S., a writer of insur ance for \\nowners of boats and small watercraft.  \\nPremiums earned in the first quarter by our various primary insurers were $ 507 million in 2012 and $426 million in 2011. The \\nincrease in premiums earned in 2012 was primarily due to increased volume from the Ber kshire Hathaway Homestate Companies and \\npremiums from Princeton Insurance Company. Premium volume of our primary insurers, in general, continues to be constrained by market conditions. We have the capacity and desire to write substantially more volume if m arket conditions improve. For the first \\nquarter, our primary insurers produced underwriting gains of $ 71 million in 2012 and $56 million in 2011.  Underwriting gains as a \\npercentage of premiums earned for the first quarter of 2012 was 14%, which  was relativ ely unchanged from 2011.  \\nInsurance —Investment Income \\n \\nA summary of net investment income of our insurance operations follows.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  \\n Insurance —Und erwriting (Continued)  \\nInsurance —Investment Income (Continued)  \\nInvestment income consists of interest and dividends earned on cash and investments of our insurance businesses. Pre -tax \\ninvestment income in the first quarter of 2012 was $1, 052 million, a decline of $ 209 million ( 17%) from 2011. The decline in \\ninvestment income in 2012 was attributable to the redemptions in 2011 of our investments in Goldman Sachs 10% Preferred Stock \\n(approximately 87% of the $5 billion aggregate investment was held by insuranc e subsidiaries) and in General Electric 10% Preferred \\nStock ($3 billion). Dividends earned by insurance subsidiaries from these investments were $ 278 million in the first quarter of 2011. \\nOur investment income earned over the remainder of 2012 will likely be negatively affected by these redemptions, given the \\ncomparatively lower yields currently available from new investment opportunities. In 2012 , investment income was favorably \\nimpacted by increased dividend rates with respect to several of our common sto ck holdings.  Investment income for the first quarter of \\n2012 also included dividends earned from our investment in Bank of America 6% Preferred Stock; of which our insurance subsidi aries \\nhold $4 billion in aggregate liquidation amount.  \\nInvested assets deri ve from shareholder capital and reinvested earnings as well as net liabilities under insurance contracts or \\n“float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and  other \\nliabilities to p olicyholders less premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance \\ncontracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $ 71.7 billion at March  31, 2012 and $70.6  billion at December  31, \\n2011. In the first quarter of 2012, t he cost of float, as represented by the ratio of our underwriting gain or loss to average float, was \\nnegative as our insurance group generated a net underwriting gain. For the first quarter of 2011, the cost of float was appro xima tely \\n2%, as our insurance businesses, in the aggregate, generated a net underwriting loss.  \\nA summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses follows.

Revenues \\nfrom each of the four business groups increased as compared to 2011, reflecting a 7% increase in average revenues per car/unit, as \\nwell as a 3% increase in the volume of cars/units handled. Revenues in each period include fuel surcharges to customers under  \\nprograms intended to recover incremental fuel costs when fuel prices exceed threshold fuel prices. F uel surcharge s increased  by 16% \\nas compared to 2011 which is reflected in average revenue per car/unit .  \\nThe 3% increase in volume is comprised of increases of 6% and 11% in cars/units handled in the consumer products and \\nindustrial products groups, respectiv ely, combined with 4% and 5% decreases in volume for coal products and agricultural products, \\nrespectively. The consumer products volume increase was attributable primarily to higher domestic intermodal and automotive \\nvolume. The decline in coal unit volum e was attributable to decreased coal demand as a result of low natural gas prices, a mild winter \\nand rising utility stockpiles. Industrial products volume increased primarily as a result o f increased shipments of petroleum products , \\nas well as  increased st eel and sand shipments . Agricultural product volume decreased due to a decline in wheat shipments for export \\npartially offset by higher U.S. corn shipments.  \\nOperating expenses in the first quarter of 2012 were approximately $3.7 billion, representing an in crease of $307 million \\n(9%)  over 2011. Fuel expenses increased $156  million in 2012 primarily due to higher fuel prices and volume increases, partially \\noffset by improved fuel efficiency. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $42 million, reflecting  volume -related costs, as \\nwell as inflation. Purchased services expenses increased $22 million due primarily to volume -related and locomotive maintenance \\ncosts. Materials and other expenses increased $61 million due to an unfavorable arbitration ruling in 2012.  \\nUtilities and Energy (“MidAmerican”)  \\nWe hold an 89.8% ownership interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (“MidAmerican”), which operates an \\ninternational energy business. MidAmerican’s domestic regulated energy interests are comprised of tw o regulated utility companies, \\nPacifiCorp and MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”). MidAmerican also operates two interstate natural gas pipeline companies. \\nIn the United Kingdom, MidAmerican operates two electricity distribution businesses, operating as Nor thern Powergrid Holdings \\nCompany (“Northern Powergrid”). The rates that utility and natural gas pipeline companies charge customers for energy and oth er \\nservices are generally subject to regulatory approval.

The increase in \\nwholesale and other revenues was due to higher volumes of $32 million on higher short -term sales from increased thermal generation \\navailability and improved natural gas spark spreads, partially offset by lower  average market prices on short -term wholesale sales.  \\nAdditionally, renewable energy credit revenue increased $16  million.   \\nPacifiCorp’s earnings before corporate interest and income taxes (“EBIT”) in the first quarter of 2012 were $208 million, an \\nincrease  of $18 million (9%) over the first quarter of 2011. Earnings were favorably impacted by h igher revenue s and lower interest \\nexpense, which were largely offset  by higher energy costs ( $62 million ) and higher depreciation and amortization ( $6 million ). Ene rgy \\ncosts in 2012 increased due to reduced gains from electricity swap settlement s ($51 million ), higher thermal generation and the impact \\nof energy adjustment mechanisms ( $15 million ), and were partially offset by lower purchased power volumes . \\nMEC ’s first quarter 2012 revenues of $881 million declined $104 million (11%)  and its EBIT of $56 million declined $15 \\nmillion (21%)  from the first quarter of 2011.  MEC’s regulated electric revenues and earnings in the first quarter of 2012 were \\nrelatively unchanged  from 2011.  Regulated natural gas revenue s decreased $70  million (21%) for the first quarter of 2012 compared \\nto the first quarter of 2011 primarily attributable to lower average per -unit cost of gas sold and an 8% decline in volumes sold as a \\nresult of  unseasonably warm weather . Nonregulated and other operating revenue s decreased $38  million due to lower electricity and \\nnatural gas prices and volumes.   The decline in EBIT was primarily attributable to lower r egulated natural gas volume -related margins  \\nand lower non regulated electric margins, partially offset by lower interest expense.  \\nNatural gas pipeline revenues increased $ 5 million (2%) for the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of 2011. The \\nrevenue increase was  primarily due to  incre ased capacity  from Kern River ’s Apex Expansion project , which was placed in service in \\nOctober  of 2011,  and from better natural gas price spreads, partially  offset by contract expirations . Natural gas pipeline EBIT \\nincreased $5  million (3%) for the first q uarter of 2012 versus 2011 which was primarily due to the higher revenue s, partially offset by \\nhigher depreciation associated with  the Kern River Apex Expansion project .  \"),\n",

Marmon’s first quarter 2012 revenues were approximately $1.8 billion , an increase of $119 million \\n(7%) as compared to the first quarter of 2011. Overall , eight of the eleven business sectors generated increased revenues compared to \\nthe first quarter of 2011.  Nearly half of the increase in revenues was attributable to recent bolt -on business acquisitions in the Crane \\nServices, Highway Technologies and Engineered Wire & Cable sectors.  In addition, the  Transportation Services & Engineered \\nProducts , Distribution  Services and Highway Technologies  sectors  (excluding acquisitions) generated significant revenue increases  in \\nthe first quarter of 2012.  The revenue increases were partially offset by significantly lower comparative revenues from the Flow \\nProducts and Re tail Store Fixtures sectors. The Retail Store Fixtures sector continues to be impacted by significantly reduced activity \\nof its major customer.  The Flow Products revenues were impacted by lower copper prices, as well as by lower volume from its \\nindustrial customers.  \\nPre-tax earnings were $269 million in the first quarter of 2012, an increase of $47 million (21%) as compared to the first quarte r \\nof 2011.  A ll but two sectors produced comparable or increased pre -tax earnings in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the first \\nquarter of 2011. The aforementioned business acquisitions accounted for approximately 20% of the pre -tax earnings increase in the \\nfirst quarter of 2012. In addition, t he Transportation Services & Engineered Products, Distribution Services, Highway Technologies \\nand Engineered Wire & Cable sectors (excluding acquisitions) generated significant increases in pre -tax earnings , while earnings from \\nthe Retail Store Fixtures and Flow Products sectors declined for the reasons indicated above.  Pre -tax earnings as a percent of revenues \\nwas 15.0% in the first quarter of 2012 compared to 13.3% in the first quarter of 2011.  The improvement in earnings as a perc ent of \\nrevenues reflects the continued emphasis of Marmon’s business model which fosters margin growth. In addition to the impact of \\nrecent acquisitions, improvements in revenues and pre -tax earnings generally reflected continued strength in some of Marmon’s end \\nmarkets, increased product innovation and ongoing effort s to control overhead cost s.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  \\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)  \\nMcLane Company  \\nThrough McLane, we operate a wholesale distribution business that provides gr ocery and non- food products to retailers, \\nconvenience stores and restaurants. McLane’s business is marked by high sales volume and very low profit margins. McLane’s \\nsignificant customers include Wal -Mart, 7 -Eleven and Yum! Brands. Approximately 30% of McLa ne’s annual revenues are \\nattributable to Wal- Mart. A curtailment of purchasing by Wal -Mart or another of its significant customers could have a material \\nadverse impact on McLane’s periodic revenues and earnings. In 2010, McLane acquired Empire Distributors , based in Georgia and \\nNorth Carolina, and Horizon Wine and Spirits Inc., based in Tennessee. Empire and Horizon are wholesale distributors of disti lled \\nspirits, wine and beer.  \\nRevenues for the first quarter of 2012 were $8,073 million, an increase of $306 million (3.9%) over 2011, reflecting revenue \\nincreases from the grocery, foodservice and beverage distribution operations. Pre- tax earnings in the first quarter of 2012 were $102 \\nmillion, an increase of $20 million over 2011. The increase in pre -tax earn ings was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of \\nchanges in LIFO inventory reserves and comparatively lower professional fees .  \\nOther manufacturing  \\nOur other manufacturing businesses include several manufacturers of building products (Acme Bui lding Brands, Benjamin \\nMoore, Johns Manville, Shaw and MiTek) and apparel (led by Fruit of the Loom which includes the Russell athletic apparel and sporting goods business and the Vanity Fair Brands women’s intimate apparel business). Also included in this  group are Forest River, \\na leading manufacturer of recreational  vehicles, IMC Metalworking Companies (“I SCAR ”), an industry leader in the metal cutting \\ntools business with operations worldwide and CTB, a manufacturer of equipment and systems for the livest ock and agricultural \\nindustries. Other manufacturing businesses also include The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”), a specialty chemical manufactu rer \\nthat we acquired on  September  16, 2011.\\n \\nRevenues from our other manufacturing activities for the first qua rter of 2012 were $6,504 million, an increase of $1,951 \\nmillion (43%)  over 2011. In 2012, revenues from Lubrizol were $1,576 million. For the first quarter of 2012, we also experienced \\nrevenue increases from sales of building products (7.5%) , recreation al vehicles (19.6% ) and apparel (6.5%). While revenues in 201 2 \\nfrom the building products group increased over 2011 , these businesses, generally, continue to be negatively impacted by slow \\nconstruction activity, particularly in the single -family housing marke ts. \\nPre-tax earnings of our other manufacturing businesses in the first quarter of 2012 were $815 million, an increase of $371 \\nmillion (8 4%) versus 2011, which was primarily due to the inclusion of Lubrizol ’s earnings . Excluding the impact of Lubrizol, \\nearnings in the first quarter of 2012 increased $72 million ( 16%) compared to  2011.  The increase was primarily attributable to \\nincreased earnings from our building products businesses. With the exception of bricks, all of our building products business es as well \\nas ISCAR and several of our other diverse manufacturing businesses generated higher earnings in 2012 over 2011 somewhat offset by \\ndecreased earnings from our apparel businesses . Also, s everal of our manufacturers experienced higher commodity costs of certain \\nraw materials , as well as higher energy costs over the past year. As a result, we have increased selling prices for certain products. To \\nthe extent that costs continue to stay at current elevated levels or increase, further selling price actions wi ll likely be necessary.  \\nOther service  \\nOur other service businesses include NetJets, the world’s leading provider of fractional ownership programs for general aviat ion \\naircraft and FlightSafety, a provider of high technology training to operators of aircraf t. Among the other businesses included in this \\ngroup are: TTI, a leading electronic components distributor; Business Wire, a leading distributor of corporate news, multimed ia and \\nregulatory filings; Pampered Chef, a direct seller of high quality kitchen to ols; Dairy Queen, which licenses and services a system of \\nover 6,100 stores that offer prepared dairy treats and food; Buffalo News  and the Omaha World -Herald (acquired at the end of 2011) , \\npublisher s of daily and Sunday newspaper s; and businesses that pro vide management and other services to insurance companies.  \\nRevenues of our other service businesses were $2,04 7 million in the first quarter of 2012, an increase of $7 9 million \\n(4%)  compared to 2011. Pre -tax earnings were $205 million in the first quarter  of 2012, an increase of $5 million (2.5%) versus 2011.  \\nThe increase in revenues in 2012 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the Omaha World- Herald and revenue increases from \\nFlightSafety and NetJets. The increase in earnings in 2012 reflected increased earnings at NetJets, partially offset by lower earnings \\nfrom TTI.  The improvement in comparative first quarter earnings of NetJets, was largely due to fees incurred in the first quarter of \\n2011 to cancel certain aircraft purchases under a purcha se agreement entered into several years earlier and lower foreign currency \\nexchange losses affecting operations outside of the United States in 2012. In the first quarter of 2011, TTI experienced very strong \\ndemand, which favorably impacted revenues and ea rnings. Over the last half of 2011 and into the first quarter of 2012, demand \\nsoftened and price competition intensified, which put downward pressure on TTI’s margins. As a result, TTI’s pre -tax earnings for the \\nfirst quarter of 2012 declined 22 % versus th e first quarter of 2011.  '),\n",

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  \\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)  \\nRetailing  \\nOur retailing operations consist of four home furnishings businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and \\nJordan’s), three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge) and See’s Candies. Revenues and pre -tax earnings in the \\nfirst quarter of 2012 from the retailing businesses increased $58 million (8%) and $18 million (58%), respectively , over the first \\nquarter of 2011. First quarter 2012 revenues of the home furnishings businesses increased $42 million (9%) over 2011, while pre -tax \\nearnings in 2012 increased $13 million (53%).  \\nFinan ce and Financial Products  \\nOur finance and financial products businesses include manufactured housing and finance (“Clayton Homes”), transportation \\nequipment leasing (“XTRA”), furniture leasing (“CORT”) as well as various miscellaneous financing activiti es. A summary of \\nrevenues and earnings from our finance and financial products businesses follows. Amounts are in millions.  \\n     \\n  First Quarter   \\n  \\n  Revenues   \\n  Earnings   \\n  \\n  2012  \\n  2011  \\n  2012  \\n  2011  \\n  \\nManufactured housing and finance  ................................ ................................ ...........................   $ 718  $ 671  $ 40  $ 32  \\nFurniture/transportation equipment leasing  ................................ ................................ ..............    176   169   26   21  \\nOther  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .........    65   73   97   103  \\n        $ 959  $ 913    \\n      \\nPre-tax earnings  ................................ ................................ ................................ ........................        163   156  \\nIncome taxes and noncontrolling interests  ................................ ................................ ................        59   60  \\n          \\n    $ 104  $ 96  \\n        \\nRevenues of Clayton Homes in the first quarter of 2012 were $718 million, an increase of $47 million (7%) over 2011. \\nRevenues from home sales in the first quarter of 201 2 increased $63 million (22%) over 2011, due to a 32% increase i n units sold \\npartially offset by a lower average price per unit  due primarily to product mix changes . Financial services revenues for the first quarter \\nof 2012 declined $16 million from 2011, due primarily to lower interest income from installment loans.  Installment loan and finance \\nreceivable balances were approximately $12.7 billion, a decrease of approximately $200 million from December 31, 2011. Clayton \\nHomes pre -tax earnings were $40 million for the first quarter of 2012, an increase of $8 million (25%) over 2011, which was primarily \\nattributable to the increase in unit sales and gross sales margins, partially offset by lower financial services earnings.  \\nClayton Homes’ operating results continue to be negatively affected by the ongoing soft housing ma rkets and the surplus of \\ntraditional single family homes for sale. In addition, our manufactured housing programs continue to operate at a competitive  \\ndisadvantage compared to traditional single family housing markets, which have been receiving significant  interest rate subsidies from \\nthe U.S. government through government agency insured mortgages. For the most part, these subsidies are not available to fact ory \\nbuilt homes. Nevertheless, Clayton Homes remains the largest manufactured housing business in the  United States and we believe that \\nit will continue to operate profitably, even under the current conditions.  \\nRevenues and pre -tax earnings of CORT and XTRA increased slightly in 2012 compared to 2011. The increases primarily \\nreflected higher furniture rental income.  \\nEarnings from our other finance business activities include investment income from a portfolio of fixed maturity and equity \\ninvestments and from a small portfolio of long -held commercial real estate loans. In addition, other earnings include i ncome from \\ninterest rate spreads charged to Clayton Homes on borrowings ( approximately $11. 3 billion as of March 31, 2012) by a  Berkshire \\nfinancing subsidiary . The borrowings were made to fund the loans to Clayton  Homes . A corresponding charge is reflected  in Clayton \\nHomes’ earnings. In addition, other finance business earnings for the first quarter include guaranty fee income of $9 million in 2012 and $11  million in 2011 from NetJets. C orresponding expenses  are recorded by NetJets , which reduced its earnin gs in both periods.\\n '),\n",

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  \\nInvestment and Derivative Gains/Losses  \\nA summary of investment and derivative gains and losses and other -than- temporary impa irment losses on investments follows. \\nAmounts are in millions.  \\n   \\n  First Quarter   \\n  \\n  2012  \\n  2011  \\n  \\nInvestment gains/losses  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .  $ 231  $ 99  \\nOther -than-temporary impairment losses on investments  ................................ ................................ .............

The timing of gains or losses from sales or \\nredemptions can have a material effect on periodic earnings. Investment gains and losses usually have minimal impact on the p eriodic \\nchanges in our consolidated shareholders’ equity since most o f our investments are regularly recorded at fair value in the Consolidated \\nBalance Sheets with the unrealized gains and losses included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other \\ncomprehensive income.  \\nWe believe the amount of investment  gains/losses included in earnings in any given period typically has little analytical or \\npredictive value. Our decisions to sell securities are not motivated by the impact that the resulting gains or losses will ha ve on our \\nreported earnings. Although our  management does not consider investment gains and losses in a given period as necessarily \\nmeaningful or useful in evaluating periodic earnings, we are providing information to explain the nature of such gains and losses when they are reflected in earnings . \\nOther -than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses in the first quarter of 2012 were related to our investments in Texas \\nCompetitive Electric Holdings bonds. In 2011, OTTI losses related to our investments in Kraft Foods ($169 million) and Wells Fargo \\n($337 million).  The OTTI losses recorded in the first quarter s of 2012 and 2011 had no impact whatsoever on the asset values \\nrecorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets or on our consolidated shareholders’ equity  as of March 31, 2012 and 2011. Although we \\nhave periodically recorded OTTI losses in earnings in the past, we continue to hold positions in many of these securities. The \\nrecognition of such losses in earnings rather than in accumulated other comprehensive income does not necessarily indicate th at sales \\nare imminent or planned and sales ultimately may not occur for numerous years or even decades. Furthermore, the recognition o f \\nOTTI losses does not necessarily indicate that the loss in value of the security is permanent or that the market price of the security will \\nnot subsequently increase to and ultimately exceed our original cost. \\n \\nWe consider several factors in determining whether or not  impairments are deemed to be other than temporary, including the \\ncurrent and expected long -term business prospects a nd if applicable, the creditworthiness of the issuer, our ability and intent to hold \\nthe investment until the price recovers and the length of time and relative magnitude of the price decline. Security prices m ay remain \\nbelow cost for a period of time that may be deemed excessive from the standpoint of interpreting existing accounting rules , even \\nthough other factors suggest that the prices will eventually recover. As a result, accounting regulations may require that we recognize \\nOTTI losses in earnings in instances where we may strongly believe that the market price of the impaired security will recover to at least our original cost and where we possess the ability and intent to hold the security until, at least, that time.  \\nAs of March  31, 201 2, unrealized losses on our investments in equity securities (determined on an individual purchase lot basis) \\nwere $274 million. Unrealized losses averaged 8% of cost. In our judgment, the future earnings potential and underlying business \\neconomics of these companies ar e favorable and we possess the ability and intent to hold these securities until their prices recover. \\nChanging market conditions and other facts and circumstances may change the business prospects of these issuers as well as ou r \\nability and intent to hold  these securities until their prices recover.  \\nOur derivative contracts generated gains of $ 1,002 million in the first quarter of 201 2 and $ 271 million in the first quarter of \\n2011 . Derivative gains/losses primarily represent the changes in fair value of ou r credit default and equity index put option contracts. \\nThe periodic changes in the fair values of these contracts can be significant, reflecting the volatility of underlying equity  and credit \\nmarkets. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our re maining equity index put option contracts will be determined as of the \\ncontract expiration dates, which begin in 2018.  '),\n",

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  \\nInvestment and Derivative Ga ins/Losses (Continued)  \\nIn the first quarter of 2012 , our equity index put option contracts produced gains of $ 689 million, due primarily  to higher equity \\nprices, partially offset by lower interest rate assumptions. In the first quarter of 2011, gains from our equity index put option contracts \\nof $223 million  were  primarily  due to higher interest rate assumptions.  Our credit default contracts generated gains of $ 340 million \\nand $70 million in the first quarters of 2012 and 2011, respectively. The gains in b oth periods were primarily due to the narrowing of \\ncredit default spreads as well as the passage of time. W e paid losses of $62 million in the first quarter of 2012 with respect to our \\ncorporate high yield contracts.  \\nFinancial Condition  \\nOur balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Our consolidated shareholders’ equity at \\nMarch  31, 2012  was $176.0  billion, an increase of $ 11.1 billion from December  31, 2011 . Consolidated cash and investments of \\ninsurance and ot her businesses approximated $167.3 billion at March 31, 2012  including cash and cash equivalents of $33 .6 billion . \\nThese assets are held predominantly in our insurance businesses. On January  31, 2012, we issued an additional $1.7 billion of parent \\ncompany senior unsecured notes, the proceeds of which were used to fund the repayment of $1.7 billion of notes that matured in \\nFebruary 2012.  \\nIn late September 2011, our Board of Directors authorized Berkshire Hathaway to repurchase Class  A and Class B shares o f \\nBerkshire at prices no higher than a 10% premium over the book value of the shares. Berkshire may repurchase shares in open m arket \\npurchases or through privately negotiated transactions, at management’s discretion. The repurchase program is expected to continue \\nindefinitely, but does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any dollar amount or number of Class  A or Class B shares. Berkshire plans \\nto use cash on hand to fund repurchases and repurchases will not be made if they would reduce Berkshire’s consolid ated cash \\nequivalent holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at \\nBerkshire. To date, share repurchases have been insignificant.  \\nOur railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and MidAmerican) maintain very large investments in capital \\nassets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make capital expenditures in the normal course of business. In the first \\nquarter of 2012, MidAmerican’s capital expenditures were $ 756 million  and BNSF’s capital expenditures were $ 787 million. For the \\nremainder of 2012, MidAmerican’s forecasted capital expenditures are $3. 0 billion, while BNSF’s forecasted capital commitments  are \\napproximately $3.1 billion. Future capital expenditur es are expected to be funded from cash flows from operations and debt issuances . \\nIn 2012, BNSF issued debt of $1. 25 billion with maturities in 202 2 and 204 2, and its outstanding debt increased $ 1.2 billion to $1 3.8 \\nbillion  as of March 31, 2012. In 2012, Mi dAmerican’s new borrowings were $1. 6 billion and its aggregate outstanding borrowings \\nincreased $ 783 million to $ 20.7 billion  as of March 31, 2012. MidAmerican and BNSF have aggregate debt and capital lease \\nmaturities over the remainder of 2012 of $1 .6 bil lion. Berkshire has committed until February  28, 2014 to provide up to $2 billion of \\nadditional capital to MidAmerican to permit the repayment of its debt obligations or to fund its regulated utility subsidiaries. Berkshire \\ndoes not guarantee the repayment  of debt issued by BNSF, MidAmerican or any of their subsidiaries.  \\nAssets of the finance and financial products businesses, which consisted primarily of loans and finance receivables, fixed \\nmaturity securities, other investments and cash and cash equival ents, were approximately $25. 5 billion as of March 31, 2012  and \\n$25.0 billion at December  31, 201 1. Liabilities were approximately $24 .0 billion as of March 31, 2012  and $25 .4 billion as of \\nDecember  31, 2011 . As of March 31, 2012 , notes payable and other b orrowings of $13 .7 billion included approximately $11. 3 billion \\nof notes issued by BHFC. In January 2012, $250 million of BHFC notes matured and an additional $2.45 billion will mature in the \\nsecond and third quarters of 2012. We currently intend to issue new debt through BHFC to replace some or all of the BHFC debt \\nmaturing in 2012. The proceeds from the BHFC notes are used to finance originated and acquired loans of Clayton Homes. The full \\nand timely payment of principal and interest on the BHFC notes is guaranteed by Berkshire.  \\nWe regularly access the credit markets, particularly through our parent company and through our railroad, utilities and energ y \\nand the finance and financial products businesses. Restricted access to credit markets at affordable rates in the future could have a significant negative impact on our operations. \\n \\nOn July  21, 2010, President Obama signed into law financial regulatory reform legislation, known as the Dodd- Frank Wall \\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Refor m Act”). The Reform Act reshapes financial regulations in the United States \\nby creating new regulators, regulating new markets and market participants and providing new enforcement powers to regulators . \\nVirtually all major areas of the Reform Act will be s ubject to regulatory interpretation and implementation rules requiring rulemaking \\nthat may take several years to complete.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  \\nFinancial Condition  (Con tinued)  \\nWe are party to several equity index put option and credit default contracts as described in Note 1 2 to the Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements. With limited exception, these contracts contain no collateral posting requirements under any circumstan ces, \\nincluding changes in either the fair value or intrinsic value of the contracts or a downgrade in Berkshire’s credit ratings. Substantially \\nall of these contracts were entered into prior to December  31, 2008. At March 31, 2012, the net liabilities recorded for such contracts \\nwere approximately $ 8.9 billion and our collateral posting requirements were $ 45 million. With respect to such collateral \\nrequirements, we receive the income attributable to such collateral or, in certain instances, interest credit fr om the counterparty. \\nAlthough the ultimate outcome of the regulatory rulemaking proceedings described in the preceding paragraph cannot be predict ed \\nwith certainty, we do not believe that the provisions of the Reform Act that concern collateral requirement s apply to derivatives \\ncontracts that were entered into prior to the enactment of the Reform Act, as ours were. As such, although the Reform Act may  \\nadversely affect some of our business activities, it is not currently expected to have a material impact on  our consolidated financial \\nresults or financial condition.  \\nContractual Obligations  \\nWe are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to \\ncounterparties in future periods. Certain ob ligations reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, require future \\npayments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. The timing and/or amount of the payment of o ther \\nobligations, such as losses arising from unpaid property and casualty loss insurance contracts and credit default and equity index put option derivatives contracts, are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps sig nificantly, \\nfrom the liability estimates currently recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Other obligations pertain to the acquisition of goods \\nor services in the future, which are not currently reflected in the financial statements, such as minimum rentals under operating lease s. \\nOur contractual obligations as of March 31, 2012 were not materially different from those disclosed in the “Contractual Obligations” \\nsection of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Berkshir e’s \\nAnnual Report on Form 10- K for the year ended December  31, 2011.  \\nCritical Accounting Policies \\n \\nCertain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments regarding transactions that have occurred and ultimate ly \\nwill be settled several years in the future  or concerning the recoverability of assets . Amounts recognized in the financial statements \\nfrom such estimates are necessarily based on assumptions about numerous factors involving varying, and possibly significant, degrees \\nof judgment and  uncertainty. Accordingly, the amounts currently recorded in the financial statements may prove, with the benefit of \\nhindsight, to be inaccurate. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Policies” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and An alysis \\nof Fina ncial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10- K for the year ended December  \\n31, 2011 for additional discussion regarding these estimates.  \\nOur Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2012 includes estimated liabilities for unpaid losses from property and casualty \\ninsurance and reinsurance contracts of $63 .7 billion. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the process of establishing loss reserve \\namounts, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude will result in a material effect on reported earnings. The effects from changes in these estimate s are \\nrecorded as a component of losses incurred in the period of  the change.  \\nOur Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31,  2012 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $53.2 billion. We evaluate \\ngoodwill for impairment at least annually and conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2011. Although we believe that the goodwill reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2012 is not impaired, goodwill may subsequently become impaired as a result of changes in facts and circumstances affecting the valuation of the reporting u nit. A \\ngoodwill impairment charge could have a material effect on periodic net earnings . '),\n",

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  \\nCritical Accounting Policies  (Continued)  \\nOur Consolidated Ba lance Sheets include significant amounts of derivative contract liabilities that are measured at fair value. \\nOur significant derivative contract exposures are concentrated in credit default and equity index put option contracts. These  contracts \\nwere primar ily entered into in over -the-counter markets and certain elements in the terms and conditions of such contracts are not \\nstandardized. In particular, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts. Furthermore, there is no sou rce of \\nindependent data available to us showing trading volume and actual prices of completed transactions. As a result, the values of t hese \\nliabilities are primarily based on valuation models, discounted cash flow models or other valuation techniques that are belie ved to be \\nused by market participants. Such models or other valuation techniques may use inputs that are observable in the marketplace,  while \\nothers are unobservable. Unobservable inputs require us to make certain projections and assumptions about the infor mation that would \\nbe used by market participants in establishing prices. Considerable judgment may be required in making assumptions, including  the \\nselection of interest rates, default and recovery rates and volatility. Changes in assumptions may have a si gnificant effect on values.  \\nInformation concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\nForward -Looking Statements  \\nInvestors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as w ell as some statements in periodic press releases \\nand some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward -looking” \\nstatements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act o f 1995 (the “Act”). Forward -looking statements \\ninclude statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which include w ords \\nsuch as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” o r similar expressions. In addition, any statements \\nconcerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or  \\nprospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by manag ement, are also forward -looking statements as \\ndefined by the Act. Forward -looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject \\nto risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries,  economic and market factors and the industries in which \\nwe do business, among other things. These statements are not guaranties of future performance and we have no specific intenti on to \\nupdate these statements.  \\nActual events and results may differ mat erially from those expressed or forecasted in forward -looking statements due to a \\nnumber of factors. The principal important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions  to differ \\nmaterially from such forward -looking s tatements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed \\nmaturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events,  such as an \\nearthquake, hurricane o r act of terrorism that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries, changes in laws or regulations \\naffecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries, changes in federal income tax laws, and cha nges in \\ngeneral economi c and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business.  \\nItem  3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  \\nReference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report and in particul ar the “Market Risk Disclosures” included \\nin “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” As of March 31, 2012, there are n o \\nmaterial changes in the market risks described in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10 -K for the year ended December  31, 2011.  \\nItem  4. Controls and Procedures  \\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10- Q, the Corporation carried out an evaluation, under the \\nsupervision and with the participation of the Corporation’s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the \\nSenior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation’s disclo sure \\ncontrols and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act  Rule 13a -15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) \\nand the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material i nformation relating to the Corporation (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required \\nto be included in the Corporation’s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Corporation’s internal control over financ ial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial \\nreporting.\\n '),\n",

Legal Proceedings  \\nWe are party in a variety of legal actions arising out of the normal course of business . In particular, such legal actions affect our \\ninsurance and reinsurance businesses. Such litigation generally seeks to establish liability directly through insurance contr acts or \\nindirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. P laintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. \\nWe do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results o f operations.  \\nItem  1A. Risk Factors  \\nOur significant business risks  are described in Item  1A to Form 10- K for the year ended December  31, 201 1 to which reference \\nis made herein.    \\nItem  2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities  \\nOn September 26, 2011, Berk shire announced a common stock repurchase program where Berkshire’s Board of Directors \\nauthorized Berkshire to repurchase Class A and Class B shares of the Company at prices no higher than a 10% premium over the book \\nvalue  of the shares.  Berkshire’s Board of Directors’ authorization does not specify a maximum number of shares to be purchased. \\nHowever,  repurchases will not be made if they would reduce Berkshire’s consolidated cash equivalent holdings below $20 billion. The \\nrepurchase program is expected to continue indefinitely and the amount of purchases will depend entirely upon the levels of cash available, the attractiveness of investment and business opportunities either at hand or on the horizon and the degree of dis count from \\nmanagement’s estimate of i ntrinsic value. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any dollar amount or \\nnumber of Class A or Class B shares.  There were no share repurchases during the first quarter of 2012.\\n \\nItem  3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities  \\nNone  \\nItem  4.

Financial information in  this\\nReport reflects any adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, neces sary\\nto a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unite d States\\n(“GAAP”). \\n \\nFor a number of reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. Th e\\ntiming and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of\\ndetermining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be relatively more significant to results of interim pe riods than\\nto results for a full year. Variations in the amount and timing of investment gains/losses can cause significant variations in periodic\\nnet earnings. Investment gains/losses are recorded when investments are disposed or are other-than-temporarily impaired. In add ition,\\nchanges in the fair value of derivative assets/liabilities associated with derivative contracts can cause significant variation s in periodic\\nnet earnings.  \\nNote 2. New accounting pronouncements  \\nIn February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, “Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Othe r\\nComprehensive Income.” ASU 2013-02 requires disclosure of the amounts reclassified out of each component of accumulated othe r\\ncomprehensive income and into net earnings during the reporting period. We adopted ASU 2013-02 on January 1, 2013 and included the required disclosures in Note 17. \\n \\nIn December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, “Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities” and in January 2013, \\nthe FASB issued ASU 2013-01, “Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.” ASU 2011-11, as clarified, enhances disclosures surrounding offsetting (netting) assets and liabilities. The standard applies to derivatives, r epurchase\\nagreements and securities lending transactions and requires companies to disclose gross and net information about financialinstruments and derivatives eligible for offset and to disclose financial instruments and derivatives subject to master nettingarrangements in financial statements. In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, “Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets fo\\nr \\nImpairment.” ASU 2012-02 allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors in determining whether events and circumstances\\nindicate that it is more-likely-than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If an entity determines that it  is not more-\\nlikely-than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then the entity is not required to perform a quantitati ve\\nimpairment test. ASU’s 2011-11 and 2012-02 were adopted on January 1, 2013 and had an immaterial effect on our ConsolidatedFinancial Statements. \\n \\nIn February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-04, “Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements fo r \\nWhich the Total Amount of the Obligation Is Fixed at the Reporting Date.” ASU 2013-04 requires an entity to measure obligations  \\nresulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date as the\\namount the reporting entity agreed to pay plus additional amounts the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its co-oblig ors. The \\nguidance further provides for disclosure of the nature and amount of the obligation. ASU 2013-04 is effective for interim and a nnual \\nreporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013. We are currently evaluating the effect this standard will have on ou r\\nConsolidated Financial Statements.  \\nNote 3. Significant business acquisitions  \\nOur long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses with consistent earning power, good returns on equity and able and\\nhonest management and at sensible prices. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we completed several smaller-sized business acquisitions, most of which we consider as “bolt-on” acquisitions to several of our existing business operations. Aggregateconsideration paid in 2012 for acquisitions was approximately $3.2 billion, which included $438 million for entities that will develop,\\nconstruct and subsequently operate renewable energy generation facilities. We do not believe that these acquisitions are materi al,\\nindividually or in the aggregate, to our Consolidated Financial Statements. \\n \\n  \\n6 '),\n",

Wrigley Jr. Company (“Wrigley”), The Dow Chemical Company (“Dow”) and Bank of America Corporation(“BAC”). A summary of other investments follows (in millions). \\n \\n  \\nIn 2008, we acquired 50,000 shares of 10% Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of GS (“GS Preferred”) and warrants to \\npurchase 43,478,260 shares of common stock of GS (“GS Warrants”) for a combined cost of $5 billion. The GS Preferred was fullyredeemed by GS on April 18, 2011. The GS Warrants remain outstanding and expire on October 1, 2013 and when originally issuedwere exercisable for an aggregate cost of $5 billion ($115/share). \\n \\nIn 2008, we acquired 30,000 shares of 10% Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of GE (“GE Preferred”) and warrants to \\npurchase 134,831,460 shares of common stock of GE (“GE Warrants”) for a combined cost of $3 billion. The GE Preferred was fullyredeemed by GE on October 17, 2011. The GE Warrants remain outstanding and expire on October 16, 2013 and when originallyissued were exercisable for an aggregate cost of $3 billion ($22.25/share). \\n \\nIn the first quarter of 2013, the GE Warrants and GS Warrants agreements were amended to provide solely for cashless\\nexercises. Upon exercise, we will receive shares of GE and GS based on the excess, if any, of the market price, as defined, ove r the\\nexercise price, without payment of additional consideration. As of March 31, 2013, the costs of these warrants include $520 mil lion o f\\nunrealized gains and losses, which were included in earnings.  \\nIn 2008, we acquired $4.4 billion par amount of 11.45% Wrigley subordinated notes due in 2018 and $2.1 billion of 5% Wrigley\\npreferred stock. The subordinated notes may be called prior to maturity at par plus the prepayment premium applicable at that t ime. In\\n2009, we also acquired $1.0 billion par amount of Wrigley senior notes due in December 2013 and 2014. We currently own $800million and an unconsolidated joint venture in which we hold a 50% economic interest owns $200 million of the Wrigley senio\\nr\\nnotes. The Wrigley subordinated and senior notes are classified as held-to-maturity and we carry these investments at cost, adj usted \\nfor foreign currency exchange rate changes that apply to certain of the senior notes. The Wrigley preferred stock is classified  as\\navailable-for-sale and recorded in our financial statements at fair value.  \\nIn 2009, we acquired 3,000,000 shares of Series A Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock of Dow (“Dow Preferred”) \\nfor a cost of $3 billion. Under certain conditions, we can convert each share of the Dow Preferred into 24.201 shares of Dow co mmon\\nstock (equivalent to a conversion price of $41.32 per share). Beginning in April 2014, if Dow’s common stock price exceeds $53. 72 \\nper share for any 20 trading days in a consecutive 30-day window, Dow, at its option, at any time, in whole or in part, may con vert\\nthe Dow Preferred into Dow common stock at the then applicable conversion rate. The Dow Preferred is entitled to dividends at a  rate\\nof 8.5% per annum.  \\nOn September 1, 2011, we acquired 50,000 shares of 6% Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of BAC (“BAC Preferred”) and \\nwarrants to purchase 700,000,000 shares of common stock of BAC (“BAC Warrants”) for a combined cost of $5 billion. The BAC \\nPreferred is redeemable at any time by BAC at a price of $105,000 per share ($5.25 billion in aggregate).

Accordingly, the OTTI losses that are included in earnings are generally offset by a\\ncorresponding credit to other comprehensive income and therefore have no net effect on shareholders’ equity as of the balance s heet \\ndate. In the first quarter of 2013 and 2012, the OTTI losses related to bonds issued by Texas Competitive Electric Holdings.

T hese\\nborrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants including, but not limited to, leverage ratios, interest coverage ra tios and\\ndebt service coverage ratios. In March 2013, BNSF issued $1.5 billion in new debentures consisting of $700 million of 3.0%debentures due in 2023 and $800 million of 4.45% debentures due in 2043. BNSF’s borrowings are primarily unsecured. As o\\nf \\nMarch 31, 2013, BNSF and MidAmerican and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable covenants. Berkshire does no t\\nguarantee any debt or other borrowings of BNSF, MidAmerican or their subsidiaries.  \\n  \\n  \\nThe borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by\\nBerkshire.

Fair value measurements (Continued)   \\n  \\nThe fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. Considerable\\njudgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates\\npresented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in an actual current market exchange. The use o f\\nalternative market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value.  \\nThe hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below.  \\nLevel 1  – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Substantially\\nall of our investments in equity securities are traded on an exchange in active markets and fair values are based on the closin g\\nprices as of the balance sheet date.  \\nLevel 2  – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for simila r\\nassets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in i nactive\\nmarkets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and\\nyield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived pri ncipally\\nfrom or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Fair values of investments in fixed maturitysecurities and notes payable and other borrowings are primarily based on price evaluations which incorporate market prices fo\\nr\\nidentical instruments in inactive markets and market data available for instruments with similar characteristics. Pricingevaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with simila\\nr\\ncharacteristics, such as credit rating, estimated duration and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the sa me\\nindustry sector.  \\nLevel 3  – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its\\nown assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and  we\\nmay be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain\\nprojections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in pricing assets or liabilities. F air\\nvalue measurements of non-exchange traded derivative contracts and certain other investments are based primarily on valuation\\nmodels, discounted cash flow models or other valuation techniques that are believed to be used by market participants.  \\nReconciliations of assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significan t\\nunobservable inputs (Level 3) for the first quarter of 2013 and 2012 follow (in millions).  \\n  \\n  \\n17    Investments\\nin fixed \\nmaturity\\nsecurities   Investments\\nin equity\\nsecurities   Other \\ninvestments    Net\\nderivativ e\\ncontract\\nliabilities  \\nBalance at December 31, 2011    $ 784  $ 22  $11,669     $(9,908 ) \\nGains (losses) included in:        \\nEarnin gs   —   (1)   —       1,022  \\nOther com prehensive income   6  11    2,489     (3) \\nRegulator y assets and liabilities  —  —   —       9 \\nAcquisitions, dis positions and settlements    (6)  —    —       31  \\nTransfers into (out of) Level 3    (129)  —    —       —  \\n               \\nBalance at March 31, 2012   $ 655  $3 2  $ 14,158    $(8,849) \\n   \\n     \\n       \\nBalance at December 31, 2012   $ 652 $ 35 $15,750     $(7,847 ) \\nGains (losses) included in:        \\nEarnin gs   —   —    520     1,235  \\nOther com prehensive income   (2)  —    399     (3) \\nRegulator y assets and liabilities   —   —    —       1 \\nDispositions    (1)  —    —       —  \\nSettlements, net    —   —    —       (27) \\nTransfers into (out of) Level 3    —   —    —       —  \\n                          \\nBalance at March 31, 2013    $ 649  $ 35  $16,669     $(6,641 ) \\n                 \\n      '),\n",

We did not adjust these prices and therefore, they have been excluded from the preceding table. \\n \\nOur other investments that are carried at fair value consist of a few relatively large private placement transactions and inclu de\\nperpetual preferred stocks and common stock warrants. These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferabil ity\\nand/or provisions that prevent us from economically hedging our investments. In applying discounted estimated cash flow techniq ues\\nin valuing the perpetual preferred stocks, we made assumptions regarding the expected durations of the investments, as the issu ers\\nmay have the right to redeem or convert these investments. We also made estimates regarding the impact of subordination, as the\\npreferred stocks have a lower priority in liquidation than investment grade debt instruments of the issuers, which affected the  discount\\nrates. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model areobservable, we are subject to the aforementioned contractual restrictions. We have applied discounts with respect to the contra ctual\\nrestrictions. Increases or decreases to these inputs would result in decreases or increases to the fair values. \\n \\nOur equity index put option and credit default contracts are not exchange traded and certain contract terms are not standard in\\nderivatives markets. For example, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts and many contracts have lo ng\\ndurations, and therefore are illiquid. For these and other reasons, we classified these contracts as Level 3. The methods we us e to\\nvalue these contracts are those that we believe market participants would use in determining exchange prices with respect to ou r \\ncontracts.  \\nWe value equity index put option contracts based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Inputs to this model include\\ncurrent index price, contract duration, dividend and interest rate inputs (which include a Berkshire non-performance input) whi ch are \\nobservable. However, the valuation of long-duration options is inherently subjective, given the lack of observable transactions  and\\nprices, and acceptable values may be subject to wide ranges. Expected volatility inputs represent our expectations after consid ering\\nthe remaining duration of each contract and that the contracts will remain outstanding until the expiration dates without offse tting\\ntransactions occurring in the interim. Increases or decreases in the volatility inputs will produce increases or decreases in t he fai r\\nvalues.  \\nOur state and municipality credit default contract values reflect credit spreads, contract durations, interest rates, bond pric es and\\nother inputs believed to be used by market participants in estimating fair value. We utilize discounted cash flow valuation mod els,\\nwhich incorporate the aforementioned inputs as well as our own estimates of credit spreads for states and municipalities where there\\nis no observable input. Increases or decreases to the credit spreads will produce increases or decreases in the fair values.  \\n  \\n18   Fair \\nvalue   Principal valuation\\ntechniques  Unobservable Inpu t  Weighted\\nAverage\\nOther investments:      \\nPreferred stocks  $11,912   Discounted cash flow Expected duration  7 years\\n   Discount for transferability \\nrestrictions and subordination  97 basis\\npoints\\nCommon stock warrants  \\n 4,757  \\n Warrant pricing model\\n Discount for transferability and \\nhedging restrictions  15%\\nNet derivative liabilities:      \\nEquity index put options  6,264   Option pricing model  Volatilit y  20%\\nCredit default-\\nstates/munici palities   427  \\n Discounted cash flow\\n Credit spreads\\n 82 basis\\npoints'),\n",

Common stock  \\nChanges in Berkshire’s issued and outstanding common stock during the first quarter of 2013 are shown in the table below.  \\n  \\n  \\nEach Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights\\nequal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses votingrights equivalent to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Del aware\\nGeneral Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock isconvertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible in to\\nClass A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,643,397 shares outstanding as of March 31, 2013and 1,642,945 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2012. In addition to our common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock are\\nauthorized, but none of which are issued and outstanding. \\n \\nIn 2011, Berkshire’s Board of Directors (“Berkshire’s Board”) approved a common stock repurchase program. Under the\\nprogram, as amended in December 2012, Berkshire may repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices no higher than a 20%premium over the book value of the shares. Berkshire may repurchase shares in the open market or through privately negotiated\\ntransactions. Berkshire’s Board authorization does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchas es\\nwill not be made if they would reduce Berkshire’s consolidated cash equivalent holdings below $20 billion. The repurchase progr am \\nis expected to continue indefinitely and the amount of repurchases will depend entirely upon the level of cash available, theattractiveness of investment and business opportunities either at hand or on the horizon, and the degree of discount of the mar ket price\\nrelative to management’s estimate of intrinsic value. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any doll a\\nr\\namount or number of Class A or Class B shares. In December 2012, Berkshire repurchased 9,475 Class A shares and 606,499 Class B\\nshares for approximately $1.3 billion through a privately negotiated transaction and market purchases.  \\n  \\n19    Class A, $5 Par Value\\n(1,650,000 shares authorized)Class B, $0.0033 Par Value \\n(3,225,000,000 shares authorized)\\n   Issued   Treasury Outstanding Issued   Treasury   Outstanding\\nBalance at December 31, 2012     904,528     (9,573 )  894,955   1,123,393,956     (1,408,484 )   1,121,985,472  \\nConversions of Class A common stock to \\nClass B common stock and exercises of replacement stock options issued in a \\nbusiness ac\\nquisition     (2,898)   —   (2,898)  5,024,428     —      5,024,428  \\n                                    \\nBalance at March 31, 2013     901,63 0    (9,573 )  892,057   1,128,418,384     (1,408,484 )   1,127,009,90 0 \\n       \\n      \\n     \\n     \\n       \\n      '),\n",

Contingencies and Commitments  \\nOn February 13, 2013, Berkshire and an affiliate of the global investment firm 3G Capital (“3G”), through a newly formed \\nholding company (“Holdco”) entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire H.J. Heinz Company (“Heinz”). Under the terms of the agreement, Heinz shareholders will receive $72.50 in cash for each outstanding share of common stock (approximately $23. 25\\nbillion in the aggregate.) Berkshire and 3G have committed to make equity investments in Holdco, which together with debt finan cing\\nto be obtained by Holdco will be used to acquire Heinz. Berkshire’s commitment is for the purchase of $4.12 billion of Holdcocommon stock and $8 billion of its preferred stock that will pay a 9% dividend. 3G has committed to purchase $4.12 billion o\\nf\\nHoldco common stock. Berkshire and 3G will each possess a 50% voting interest in Holdco and following the acquisition, a 50%voting interest in Heinz. The acquisition was approved by the shareholders of Heinz on April 30, 2013. The closing will occu\\nr\\nfollowing the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and the fulfillment of other customary closing conditions, and is expecte d to\\noccur in the latter part of the second quarter or in the third quarter of 2013.  \\nHeinz Company is one of the world’s leading marketers and producers of healthy, convenient and affordable foods specializing\\nin ketchup, sauces, meals, soups, snacks and infant nutrition. Heinz is a global family of leading branded products, including Heinz\\nKetchup, sauces, soups, beans, pasta and infant foods (representing over one third of Heinz’s total sales), Ore-Ida  potato prod ucts, \\nWeight Watchers  Smart Ones  entrées, T.G.I.

We are contractually required to acquire substantially all of the remaining noncontrolling interests of\\nMarmon no later than March 31, 2014, for an amount that will be based on Marmon’s 2013 operating results.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  \\nResults of Operations  \\nNet earnings attributable to Berkshire are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes an d\\nexclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. Amounts are in millions.  \\n  \\nThrough our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. Our operating businesses are managed on an\\nunusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing,purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business  \\nactivities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible fo\\nr\\nsignificant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the op erating\\nbusinesses. It also is responsible for coordinating Berkshire’s corporate governance efforts, including, but not limited to,\\ncommunicating the appropriate “tone at the top” messages to its employees and associates, monitoring governance efforts, includ ing\\nthose at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. The business seg ment \\ndata (Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion.  \\nOur insurance underwriting businesses generated significant underwriting gains in the first quarter of 2013, reflecting no\\nsignificant losses from catastrophes and our railroad and utilities and energy businesses continued to generate significant ear nings in\\n2013. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2013 were mixed, but as indicated in the table aboveincreased about 10% in the aggregate. \\n \\nInvestment and derivative gains/losses in the first quarter included after-tax gains from derivative contracts of $784 million in \\n2013 and $650 million in 2012, which were primarily attributable to fair value changes to our equity index put option derivativ e\\ncontracts in both 2013 and 2012 as well as our credit default derivative contracts in 2012. We believe that realized investmentgains/losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported results o\\nr\\nevaluating our economic performance. These gains and losses and changes in the equity and credit markets from period to periodhave caused and will likely continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. \\n \\nInsurance—Underwriting  \\nWe engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property/casualty, life and health risks. In primary insurance activitie s,\\nwe assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsu rance\\nactivities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselv es to in\\ntheir own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are: (1) GEICO, (2) General Re, (3) Berkshire Hathaway\\nReinsurance Group (“BHRG”) and (4) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group.  \\nOur management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations – underwriting and investing. Underwriting \\ndecisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing decisions, with limited exceptions, are the responsibility of Berkshire’s \\nChairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett. Accordingly, we evaluate the performance of underwriting operations without any allocation\\nof investment income.  \\n  \\n22    First Quarter  \\n   2013   2012  \\nInsurance – underwriting   $901   $54  \\nInsurance – investment income    799    791  \\nRailroad    798    701  \\nUtilities and ener gy   394    338  \\nManufacturin g, service and retailin g   944    854  \\nFinance and financial products    109    104  \\nOther   (163)   (177) \\nInvestment and derivative gains/losses    1,110    580  \\n            \\nNet earnin gs attributable to Berkshire    $4,892    $3,245   \\n      \\n      '),\n",

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   \\n  \\nInsurance—Underwriting  (Continued)  \\n  \\nThe timing and amount of catastrophe losses can also produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results,\\nparticularly with respect to BHRG and General Re. In the first quarter of 2013 and 2012, losses from catastrophes were notsignificant. For the purposes of this discussion, we consider catastrophe losses significant if the pre-tax losses incurred fro m a single\\nevent (or series of related events) exceed $75 million on a consolidated basis. Our periodic underwriting results are affected\\nsignificantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurre nces\\nin prior years. Periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arisin g fro\\nm\\nthe changes in the valuations of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities as a result of foreign currency ex change\\nrate fluctuations. BHRG’s underwriting results included pre-tax gains of $223 million in the first quarter of 2013 and pre-tax losses o f \\n$146 million in the first quarter of 2012 from such foreign currency exchange rate changes, which were included in underwritingexpenses. In addition, BHRG’s results for the first quarter of 2013 included a one-time pre-tax gain of $255 million arising fr o\\nm \\namendments to a life reinsurance contract.  \\nA key marketing strategy followed by all of our insurance businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength.\\nStatutory surplus of our insurance businesses was approximately $106 billion at December 31, 2012. This superior capital streng th\\ncreates opportunities, especially with respect to reinsurance activities, to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance  contracts\\nspecially designed to meet the unique needs of insurance and reinsurance buyers.  \\nA summary follows of underwriting results from our insurance businesses. Amounts are in millions.  \\n  \\nGEICO  \\nThrough GEICO, we primarily write private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and\\nthe District of Columbia. GEICO’s policies are marketed mainly by direct response methods in which customers apply for coveragedirectly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. This is a significant element in our strategy to be a low-cost auto \\ninsurer. In addition, we strive to provide excellent service to customers, with the goal of establishing long-term custome\\nr \\nrelationships. GEICO’s underwriting results are summarized below. Dollars are in millions.  \\n  \\nPremiums written in the first quarter of 2013 were $4,841 million, an increase of 11.3% as compared to the first quarter of 201 2.\\nPremiums earned in the first quarter of 2013 increased $383 million (9.5%) to $4,399 million. The growth in premiums earned fo r\\nvoluntary auto was 9.5%, as policies-in-force increased 7.4% during the past year. The increase in policies-in-force reflects a  13.6% \\nincrease in voluntary auto new business sales. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at March 31, 2013 were approximately 402,000 greater than at December 31, 2012. In recent years, the growth in voluntary auto policies-in-force has been the greatest during  the first \\nquarter. \\n \\n  \\n23    First Quarter  \\n   2013    2012  \\nUnderwritin g gain (loss) attributable to:      \\nGEICO    $ 266    $ 124  \\nGeneral Re    95     81  \\nBerkshire Hathawa y Reinsurance Grou p  974     (191) \\nBerkshire Hathawa y Primar y Grou p   54     71  \\n             \\nPre-tax underwritin g gain   1,389     85  \\nIncome taxes and noncontrollin g interests   488     31  \\n             \\nNet underwritin g gain   $ 901    $ 54  \\n      \\n       \\n   First Quarter  \\n   2013    2012  \\n   Amoun t   %    Amoun t   %  \\nPremiums earned   $4,399   100.0     $4,016      100.0 \\n                          \\nLosses and loss ad justment ex penses   3,353    76.2     2,933     73. 0 \\nUnderwritin g expenses   780   17.8     959     23.9  \\n                            \\nTotal losses and ex penses   4,133    94.0     3,892     96.9  \\n             \\n       \\n      \\nPre-tax underwritin g gain   $266     $124    \\n               \\n  '),\n",

The loss ratio (the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums  earned)\\nwas 76.2% in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 73.0% in 2012. In the first quarter of 2013 claims frequencies for property damage\\nand collision coverages increased in the two to three percent range compared to the first quarter of 2012 due to more severe wi nter\\nweather. In addition, physical damage severities increased in the three to five percent range and average bodily injury severit ies\\nincreased in the two to three percent range, although expected severities for personal injury protection coverage declined, pri marily in\\nFlorida.  \\nUnderwriting expenses in the first quarter of 2013 declined $179 million (18.7%), despite the aforementioned increase in\\npremiums earned. Underwriting expenses in the first quarter of 2012 were impacted by a change in U.S. GAAP concerning deferredpolicy acquisition costs (“DPAC”). DPAC represents the underwriting costs that are eligible to be capitalized and expensed as\\npremiums are earned over the policy period. Policy acquisition costs related to policies written and renewed after December 31,  2011\\nare being deferred at lower levels than before that date. The new accounting standard essentially accelerates the timing of whe n\\ncertain underwriting costs are recognized in earnings. The new accounting standard was adopted on a prospective basis on Januar y 1,\\n2012. As a result, DPAC recorded as of December 31, 2011 was amortized to expense over the remainder of the related policyperiods in 2012. Excluding the effects of the accounting change in 2012, the ratio of underwriting expenses to premiums earned in the\\nfirst quarter of 2013 (17.8%) was relatively unchanged from the ratio in first quarter of 2012. The new accounting standard for  DPAC\\ndoes not impact the cash basis periodic underwriting costs or our assessment of GEICO’s underwriting performance. \\n \\nGeneral Re  \\nThrough General Re, we conduct a reinsurance business offering property and casualty and life and health coverages to clients\\nworldwide. We write property and casualty reinsurance in North America on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporatio n\\nand internationally through Germany-based General Reinsurance AG and other wholly-owned affiliates. Property and casualty reinsurance is also written through brokers with respect to Faraday in London. Life and health reinsurance is written in NorthAmerica through General Re Life Corporation and internationally through General Reinsurance AG. General Re strives to generateunderwriting profits in essentially all of its product lines. Our management does not evaluate underwriting performance based u pon\\nmarket share and our underwriters are instructed to reject inadequately priced risks. General Re’s underwriting results are sum marized \\nin the following table. Amounts are in millions. \\n \\n  \\nProperty/casualty  \\nProperty/casualty premiums earned in the first quarter of 2013 were $758 million, an increase of $23 million (3.1%) compared\\nto 2012. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums earned in the first quarter of 2013 increase d $37\\nmillion (5.0%), which was primarily due to increases in international treaty business. However, price competition in most prope rty\\nand casualty lines persists. Our underwriters continue to exercise discipline by not accepting offers to write business where p rices are\\ndeemed inadequate. We remain prepared to increase premium volumes should market conditions improve.  \\nUnderwriting results in the first quarter of 2013 and 2012 included gains of $96 million and $46 million, respectively, compris ed\\nof net underwriting gains from property business, partially offset by net underwriting losses from casualty/workers’ compensati on \\nbusiness. Property business generated underwriting gains of $110 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to $66 million i n the\\nfirst quarter of 2012. Property results in each period were absent significant catastrophe losses and included favorable develo pment o f\\nprior years’ business ($46 million in 2013 versus $59 million in 2012). The favorable development in each period was primarily\\nattributable to lower than expected losses reported by clients. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe and large individual lo sses has\\nproduced and is expected to continue to produce significant volatility in periodic underwriting results.  \\n  \\n24   First Quarter\\n  Premiums earned   Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss)\\n  2013  2012   2013   2012\\nProperty/casualty    $758   $735   $ 96   $ 46 \\nLife/health    711    736     (1)   35  \\n                        \\n  $1,469    $1,471    $ 95   $ 81 \\n                   \\n     '),\n",

The underwriting losses in our casualty/workers’ compensation business were net of gains of $75 millio n in \\n2013 and $72 million in 2012 from the run-off of prior years’ losses, reflecting lower than anticipated reported losses from ce ding\\ncompanies. Casualty losses tend to be long-tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a given period m eans\\nthat the loss reserve estimates currently established will continue to develop favorably.  \\nLife/health  \\nPremiums earned in the first quarter of 2013 were $711 million, a decrease of $25 million (3.4%) compared to 2012. Adjusting\\nfor the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums earned were relatively unchanged compared to the first quar ter of\\n2012. The life/health operations produced an underwriting loss of $1 million in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to an\\nunderwriting gain of $35 million in 2012. The first quarter of 2013 underwriting loss was primarily due to higher than expectedmortality in both Europe and the U.S. and discount accretion on the U.S. long-term care business. The gains in the first quarte r o\\nf \\n2012 were primarily due to lower than expected mortality in the both the U.S. and international life businesses.  \\nBerkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”)  \\nThrough BHRG, we underwrite excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota-share coverages on property and casualty risks for insurers \\nand reinsurers worldwide. BHRG’s business includes catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance and excess primary insurance and facultative reinsurance for large or otherwise unusual property risks referred to as individual risk. BHRG also writes retroact ive\\nreinsurance, which provides indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events. Other mult i-line \\nproperty/casualty refers to various coverages written on both a quota-share and excess basis and includes a 20% quota-share con tract \\nwith Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd. (“Swiss Re”) covering substantially all of Swiss Re’s property/casualty risks that incepted  \\nbetween January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2012. The Swiss Re quota-share contract was not renewed in 2013 and is now in run-off.  \\nBHRG’s underwriting activities also include life reinsurance and annuity businesses. Amounts are in millions. \\n \\n  \\nPremiums earned in the first quarter of 2013 from catastrophe and individual risk contracts increased $39 million (29%) versus\\nthe first quarter of 2012. The level of business written in a given period will vary significantly due to changes in market con ditions \\nand management’s assessment of the adequacy of premium rates. We have generally constrained the volume of business written inrecent years as premium rates have not been attractive enough to warrant increasing volume. However, we have the capacity anddesire to write substantially more business when appropriate pricing can be obtained. \\n \\nCatastrophe and individual risk contracts may provide exceptionally large limits of indemnification. The timing and magnitude\\nof losses produces extraordinary volatility in periodic underwriting results of this business. Catastrophe and individual ris k\\nunderwriting results for the first quarter of 2013 and 2012 reflected no significant losses from catastrophe events during thos e periods.\\nIn the first quarter, underwriting results of the catastrophe and individual risk business included a gain of $16 million in 20 13 and a\\nloss of $45 million in 2012 from changes in estimates of prior years’ catastrophe losses.  \\nRetroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past los s\\nevents, and related claims are generally expected to be paid over long periods of time. Premiums and limits of indemnification are\\noften very large in amount.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   \\n  \\nInsurance —Underwriting  (Continued)  \\n  \\nBerkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) (Continued)  \\n  \\nUnderwriting results attributable to retroactive reinsurance include the recurring periodic amortization of deferred charges th at\\nare established with respect to these contracts. At the inception of a contract, deferred charges represent the difference betw een the\\npremium received and the estimated ultimate losses payable. Deferred charges are subsequently amortized over the estimated clai ms\\npayment period using the interest method, which reflects estimates of the timing and amount of loss payments. The original esti mates\\nof the timing and amount of loss payments are periodically analyzed against actual experience and revised based on an actuarial\\nevaluation of the expected remaining losses. Amortization charges and deferred charge adjustments resulting from changes to theestimated timing and amount of future loss payments are included as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses. \\n \\nThe underwriting losses from retroactive policies for the first quarter of 2013 and 2012 primarily represent the amortization o f\\ndeferred charges. At March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, unamortized deferred charges for retroactive contracts wereapproximately $4.3 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of retroactive rein surance\\ncontracts were approximately $18.5 billion at March 31, 2013 compared to approximately $18.0 billion as of December 31, 2012. \\n \\nPremiums earned from other multi-line property and casualty business in the first quarter included $556 million in 2013 and\\n$746 million in 2012 from the Swiss Re 20% quota-share contract. As previously noted, the Swiss Re quota-share contract expired  on \\nDecember 31, 2012. As of March 31, 2013, unearned premiums related to this contract were $942 million, which will be earned as the\\ncontract runs off, with a majority of that amount to be earned in 2013. Premiums earned from this contract for the entire year in 2012\\nwere approximately $3.4 billion. Premiums earned in the first quarter of 2013 from multi-line business, other than from the Swi ss Re \\nquota-share contract increased $387 million over the first quarter of 2012, which was primarily attributable to an increase in property\\nquota-share business.  \\nOther multi-line property and casualty underwriting generated a pre-tax underwriting gain of $551 million in 2013 compared to \\na pre-tax loss of $130 million in the first quarter of 2012. Multi-line property/casualty underwriting results regularly includ e foreign\\ncurrency transaction gains or losses associated with the changes in the valuation of certain reinsurance liabilities of U.S. ba sed\\nsubsidiaries (including liabilities arising under retroactive reinsurance contracts), which are denominated in foreign currenci es.  \\nMulti-line property/casualty underwriting results included foreign currency exchange rate gains of $189 million in the firs t\\nquarter of 2013 compared to losses of $135 million in the first quarter of 2012. The gains and losses in each period primarily related\\nto movements in the Swiss Franc and U.K. Pound Sterling relative to the U.S. Dollar. Underwriting results can be significantlyimpacted by the timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses, although there were no significant catastrophe loss events in the f irst\\nquarter of 2013 or 2012. In the first quarter of 2013 the Swiss Re quota-share contract produced an underwriting gain of $235 m illion,\\nan increase of $186 million over the first quarter of 2012. In the first quarter, underwriting results attributable to the Swis s Re quota-\\nshare contract included gains of $210 million in 2013 and $22 million in 2012 from decreases in estimated liabilities for prior  years’\\nlosses. \\n \\nLife and annuity premiums earned in the first quarter of 2013 were $982 million, an increase of $468 million over 2012. In the\\nfirst quarter of 2013, premiums of $1.7 billion were earned in connection with a new reinsurance contract under which BHRGassumed certain guaranteed minimum death benefit coverages on a portfolio of variable annuity reinsurance contracts that have b een\\nin run-off for a number of years. Substantially all of the premiums expected under this contract were earned at the inception o f the\\ncontract. In addition, BHRG agreed in the first quarter of 2013 to amend certain provisions of its reinsurance agreement with S wiss\\nRe Life & Health America Inc. (“SRLHA”) covering yearly renewable life insurance business. The amendments essentiallycommuted coverage with respect to a number of the underlying contracts in exchange for payments to SRLHA of $675 million. Theamendments resulted in a reversal of previously recorded premiums of approximately $1.3 billion, which was exceeded by thereversal of life benefits incurred, generating a one-time pre-tax gain of $255 million. \\n \\nIn the first quarter of 2013, the life and annuity business produced a pre-tax underwriting gain of $313 million versus an \\nunderwriting loss of $70 million in 2012. The underwriting gain in 2013 was primarily due to the impact of the aforementionedamendments to the SRLHA contract. Underwriting results also included foreign currency exchange gains of $34 million in 2013 andlosses of $11 million in 2012. These gains and losses are associated with the conversion of non-U.S. denominated annuity liabil ities \\ninto U.S. Dollars. At March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, annuity liabilities were approximately $4.1 billion and $3.8 billio n,\\nrespectively. \\n \\n  \\n26 '),\n",

In the fourth quarter of 2012, we acquired Clal U.S.Holdings, which owns GUARD Insura nce Group (“GUARD”), a provider of commercial property and casualty insurance coverage to\\nsmall and mid-sized businesses. \\n \\nPremiums earned in the first quarter by BH Primary aggregated $713 million in 2013 and $507 million in 2012. The increase\\nwas primarily due to the inclusion of GUARD and increased workers’ compensation insurance volume from the Berkshire HathawayHomestate Companies. Premium volume of certain of our other primary insurers continues to be constrained by market conditions.We have the capacity and desire to write substantially more volume if market conditions improve. For the first quarter, our pri mary\\ninsurers produced underwriting gains of $54 million in 2013 and $71 million in 2012. Underwriting gains as a percentage o\\nf\\npremiums earned for the first quarter were 8% in 2013 and 14% in 2012. The decline in comparative first quarter underwriting ga ins\\nwas primarily due to unfavorable loss experience with respect to certain general liability business of the National Indemnity\\nCompany’s primary group.  \\nInsurance—Investment Income  \\nA summary of net investment income of our insurance operations follows. Amounts are in millions.  \\n  \\nInvestment income consists of interest and dividends earned on cash and investments of our insurance businesses. Pre-tax \\ninvestment income in the first quarter of 2013 was $996 million, a decline of $56 million (5%) from 2012. The decline in pre-ta x \\ninvestment income in 2013 was attributable to a decline in interest earned from fixed maturity securities and cash and cashequivalents, partially offset by slightly higher dividends earned from equity securities. We continue to hold significant cash and cash\\nequivalents balances currently earning near zero yields, which will continue to negatively impact our earnings from investments .\\nHowever, our management believes that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and strongly insists on safety over yield with\\nrespect to cash and cash equivalents. \\n \\nInvested assets derive from shareholder capital and reinvested earnings as well as net liabilities under insurance contracts o r\\n“float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and o ther\\nliabilities to policyholders less premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance\\ncontracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $73 billion at March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012.

The overall\\nincrease in revenues reflected a 3% increase in cars/units handled and a 2% increase in average revenue per car/unit, attributa ble to\\nrates and business mix. In the first quarter of 2013, BNSF generated higher revenues from industrial products and consumer prod ucts,\\npartially offset by lower revenues from coal and agricultural products. The increase in industrial products revenues was driven  by a\\n14% increase in volume, due primarily to significantly higher petroleum products volumes. The increase in consumer products\\nrevenues reflected a 5% increase in volume, which was due primarily to increased domestic intermodal volume. In the first quart er of\\n2013, coal volume declined 3% versus 2012, primarily due to a decrease in coal demand as a result of utilities’ focus on reduci ng \\nstockpiles. Agricultural products volume in the first quarter of 2013 declined about 7% compared with the prior year period, an d was\\nmainly attributable to a decrease in corn and soybean exports as a result of the drought conditions in the U.S. in 2012. Revenu es (and\\nrevenues per car/unit) in each period include fuel surcharges to customers under programs intended to recover incremental fuel costs\\nwhen fuel prices exceed threshold fuel prices. Surcharges vary by product/commodity, and therefore amounts earned in a given pe riod\\nare impacted by business mix and volume as well as fuel costs. Fuel surcharges in the first quarter of 2013 increased by 6% as\\ncompared to 2012.  \\nOperating expenses in the first quarter of 2013 were approximately $3.8 billion, an increase of $78 million (2%) over 2012. Fue l\\nexpenses increased $27 million (2%) in 2013 primarily due to higher fuel prices and volumes, partially offset by improved fuelefficiency. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $22 million, reflecting volume-related costs and inflation, partially offset \\nby cost savings initiatives. Purchased services expenses in 2013 increased $48 million compared to 2012 due primarily to volume -\\nrelated costs, including purchased transportation for BNSF Logistics, a wholly owned, third party logistics company. In 2013,materials and other expenses declined $35 million versus 2012, which included a charge of $55 million recorded in the prior yea r fo\\nr\\nan unfavorable arbitration ruling.  \\nUtilities and Energy (“MidAmerican”)  \\nWe hold an 89.8% ownership interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (“MidAmerican”), which operates an \\ninternational energy business.

In 2013, regulated retail electric operating revenues increased $35 million, due to rateadjustment clauses in Iowa and Illinois and an increase in customer load primarily from cooler weather conditions in 2013 compa red\\nto an unseasonably warm first quarter in 2012. Regulated natural gas operating revenue increased $52 million in the first quart er o\\nf\\n2013 compared to 2012, due to higher volumes and an increase in recoveries through adjustment clauses as a result of a highe r\\naverage per-unit cost of gas sold. The increase in volumes reflected the comparatively colder weather conditions in 2013. In th e first\\nquarter of 2013, nonregulated and other operating revenues declined $40 million compared to 2012 due to lower electricity volum es\\nand lower electricity and natural gas prices, partially offset by an increase in natural gas volumes.  \\nMEC’s EBIT of $76 million increased $20 million (36%) over the first quarter of 2012, due primarily to a $15 million increase\\nin regulated natural gas operating earnings and as a result of lower interest expenses and higher allowances for equity funds u sed\\nduring construction of energy generation assets. The increase in regulated natural gas operating earnings was attributable to h igher\\nvolumes from the colder temperatures in 2013.  \\nNatural gas pipeline revenues and EBIT in the first quarter of 2013 were relatively unchanged compared to 2012. Northern\\nPowergrid’s revenues increased $37 million (14%) in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to\\nhigher distribution revenue. EBIT of Northern Powergrid in the first quarter of 2013 was $145 million, an increase of $21 milli on\\n(17%) over 2012. The increase was mainly due to the higher operating revenue, partially offset by higher distribution operating\\nexpenses.  \\nRevenues and EBIT of the real estate brokerage business in the first quarter of 2013 increased by $71 million and $7 million,\\nrespectively, compared to the first quarter of 2012. The increase in revenues was from businesses acquired subsequent to the en d of\\nthe first quarter of 2012 and from higher revenues from pre-existing businesses, reflecting a 9% increase in closed brokerage u nits\\nand a 7% increase in average home sale prices. The increase in EBIT was attributed to higher revenues, partially offset by incr eased\\ncommissions and other operating expenses.  \\n  \\n30 '),\n",

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   \\n  \\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing  \\nA summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows. Amounts are in millions.  \\n  \\nMarmon  \\nThrough Marmon, we operate over 150 manufacturing and service businesses within eleven diverse business sectors that are\\nfurther organized in three separate companies. Those companies and constituent sectors are:  \\n  \\nMarmon’s first quarter of 2013 consolidated revenues were $1.7 billion, a decrease of $63 million (4%) as compared to the firs t\\nquarter of 2012. Consolidated pre-tax earnings were $266 million in the first quarter of 2013, a decrease of $3 million (1%) as\\ncompared to the first quarter of 2012. Pre-tax earnings as a percent of revenues was 15.4% in the first quarter of 2013 compare d to\\n15.0% in the first quarter of 2012. The revenues and earnings information in the following paragraphs is before intercompanyeliminations and miscellaneous unallocated items. \\n \\nOverall, two of the three companies saw revenue decreases as compared to the first quarter of 2012. Engineered Components’\\nfirst quarter of 2013 revenues were $594 million, a decline of $54 million (8%) as compared to the first quarter of 2012. The d ecline\\nwas primarily due to a reduction in volume and lower copper prices. Natural Resources’ revenues were $612 million, a decline of  $21 \\nmillion (3%) as compared to the first quarter of 2012. This decline reflected lower external tank car sales and one-time prior year \\nprojects in the Transportation Services & Engineered Products and several large projects in the Engineered Wire & Cable sectors ,\\npartially offset by an increase in leasing revenue attributable to higher lease rates and new tank car fleet additions, as well  as growth\\nin the Crane Services Canadian operations. Retail Technologies’ revenues of $555 million increased $16 million (3.0%) as compar ed\\nto the first quarter of 2012. Rebounding demand from a major customer in the Retail Store Fixtures sector is the primary driver  for the\\nquarter-over-quarter increase.  \\nEngineered Components’ pre-tax earnings were $50 million, a decrease of $13 million (20%) as compared to the first quarter o f\\n2012. Both the Electrical & Plumbing Products and Distribution Services sectors’ pre-tax earnings declined in the first quarter  of \\n2013 primarily due to lower volumes, offset slightly by improved product mix and lower overhead costs in the Industrial Product s\\nsector and a $3 million gain on sale of land and machinery and equipment during the first quarter of 2013. Natural Resources’ p re-tax \\nearnings were $157 million, an increase of $4 million (3%) as compared to the prior year comparable quarter. The increase in pr e-tax \\nearnings was primarily driven by higher margins on specialty and utility cable products and higher rail leasing rates and new t ank ca r\\nfleet additions, partially offset by higher rail wheel repairs. Retail Technologies’ pre-tax earnings were $67 million, an incr ease of $3 \\nmillion (5%) as compared to the first quarter of 2012. Pre-tax earnings increased primarily due to strong revenue growth in the  Retail\\nStore Fixtures sector and cost savings relating to 2012 restructuring actions. Corporate overhead expenses were reduced by $3 m illion\\ndue to lower salary and legacy (litigation and environmental) costs.  \\n  \\n31    First Quarter  \\n   Revenues    Earnin gs  \\n   2013    2012    2013    2012  \\nMarmon    $1,730    $1,793     $266    $269 \\nMcLane Com pany   10,785    8,073     132     102  \\nOther manufacturin g   6,854    6,504      809     815 \\nOther service    2,104    1,939     209     198  \\nRetailin g   987   853     73     56 \\n                          \\n  $22,460    $19,162      \\n             \\n    \\nPre-tax earnin gs        1,489      1,440 \\nIncome taxes and noncontrollin g interests         545     586  \\n                 \\n      $944    $854 \\n           \\n       \\nCom pany   Secto r\\nMarmon Engineered Industrial & Metal\\nCom ponents (“En gineered Com ponents”)    Electrical & Plumbing Products, Distribution Services, Industrial Products\\nMarmon Natural Resources & Transportation \\nServices (“Natural Resources”)\\n  Transportation Services & Engineered Products, En\\ngineered Wire & Cable, Crane Services\\nMarmon Retail & End User Technologies \\n(“Retail Technologies”)  \\n  Highway Technologies, Water Treatment, Retail Store Fixtures, Food Service Equipment, Retail Home \\nIm\\nprovement Products'),\n",

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   \\n  \\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)  \\n  \\nMcLane Company  \\nThrough McLane, we operate a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food products to retailers, \\nconvenience stores and restaurants. Through its subsidiaries, McLane also operates as a wholesale distributor of distilled spir its, wine\\nand beer. On August 24, 2012, McLane acquired Meadowbrook Meat Company, Inc. (“MBM”). MBM, based in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, is a large customized foodservice distributor for national restaurant chains with annual revenues of approximately $6billion. MBM’s revenues and earnings are included in McLane’s results beginning as of the acquisition date. McLane’s grocery an d \\nfoodservice businesses are marked by high sales volume and very low profit margins and have several significant customers,\\nincluding Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven and Yum! Brands. A curtailment of purchasing by Wal-Mart or another of its significant customers could have a material adverse impact on McLane’s periodic revenues and earnings. \\n \\nRevenues for the first quarter of 2013 were $10.8 billion, an increase of $2.7 billion (34%) over 2012. The increase in revenue s\\nreflected the inclusion of MBM, as well as 11% increases in revenues of the grocery and other foodservice businesses, which wer e\\nprimarily related to several new large customers at each of the businesses. Pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2013 were $132 \\nmillion, an increase of $30 million (29%) over 2012. The increase in pre-tax earnings was primarily attributable to increased s ales and \\nrelatively stable net operating margins of the pre-existing business operations and to a lesser degree from the inclusion of MB M.  \\nOther manufacturing  \\nOur other manufacturing businesses include several manufacturers of building products (Acme Building Brands, Benjamin\\nMoore, Johns Manville, Shaw and MiTek) and apparel (led by Fruit of the Loom which includes Russell athletic apparel and VanityFair Brands women’s intimate apparel). Also included in this group are Forest River, a leading manufacturer of leisure vehicles , IMC\\nInternational Metalworking Companies (“Iscar”), an industry leader in the metal cutting tools business with operations worldwid e and\\nCTB, a manufacturer of equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries. Other manufacturing businesses alsoinclude The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”), a specialty chemical manufacturer that we acquired in 2011. \\n \\nRevenues from our other manufacturing activities for the first quarter of 2013 were $6.9 billion, an increase of $350 million\\n(5%) over 2012. In the first quarter of 2013, Forest River generated a significant increase in revenues, due to increased volum e and\\naverage sales prices. First quarter of 2013 revenues also benefited from several bolt-on business acquisitions in 2012. We also  \\nexperienced revenue increases from our building products and apparel businesses.  \\nPre-tax earnings of our other manufacturing businesses in the first quarter of 2013 were $809 million, a slight decline fro m\\n2012. Forest River, as well as our building products and apparel businesses generated higher earnings in 2013. However a declin e in\\nIscar’s earnings in 2013 versus 2012 attributable to intensifying price competition and sluggish customer demand, more than off set\\nthe aforementioned increases in pre-tax earnings. Lubrizol’s earnings in the first quarter of 2013 were unchanged compared to 2 012.  \\nOther service  \\nOur other service businesses include NetJets, the world’s leading provider of fractional ownership programs for general aviatio n\\naircraft and FlightSafety, a provider of high technology training to operators of aircraft. Among the other businesses included  in this\\ngroup are: TTI, a leading electronic components distributor; Business Wire, a leading distributor of corporate news, multimedia  and\\nregulatory filings; Dairy Queen, which licenses and services a system of over 6,200 stores that offer prepared dairy treats and  food;\\nBuffalo News and the BH Media Group, which includes the Omaha World-Herald, as well as 27 other daily newspapers and \\nnumerous other publications; and businesses that provide management and other services to insurance companies.  \\nFirst quarter of 2013 revenues of our other service businesses were $2.1 billion, an increase of $165 million (8.5%) compared t o\\n2012. Pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2013 were $209 million, an increase of $11 million (6%) versus 2012. The increas es\\nreflected increased revenues and earnings from NetJets, BH Media Group and TTI. The increase in revenues at NetJets was primari ly\\ndue to increased sales of fractional aircraft shares. Earnings at NetJets increased primarily due to improved flight operations  margins,\\nfractional sales margins and reduced net financing costs. The revenues and earnings increases from BH Media Group and TTI wereprimarily a result of bolt-on business acquisitions in 2012. \\n \\n  \\n32 '),\n",

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   \\n  \\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)  \\n  \\nRetailing  \\nOur retailing operations consist of four home furnishings businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and\\nJordan’s), three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies, Pampered Chef, a direct seller of high  \\nquality kitchen tools and Oriental Trading Company (“OTC”), a direct retailer of party supplies, school supplies and toys andnovelties, which we acquired on November 27, 2012. Revenues and pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2013 from the retailin g \\nbusinesses increased $134 million (16%) and $17 million (30%), respectively, over the first quarter of 2012. Most of these\\ncomparative increases were attributed to the inclusion of OTC and increases at See’s Candies, due primarily to the timing of Ea ster. \\n \\nFinance and Financial Products  \\nOur finance and financial products businesses include manufactured housing and finance (Clayton Homes), transportation\\nequipment leasing (XTRA), furniture leasing (CORT) as well as various miscellaneous financing activities. A summary of earningsfrom our finance and financial products businesses follows. Amounts are in millions. \\n \\n  \\nClayton Homes’ earnings were $71 million for the first quarter of 2013, an increase of $31 million (78%) compared to 2012. In\\nthe first quarter of 2013, the earnings benefitted from lower loan loss provisions and an increase in net interest income due t o the\\nreduction in interest income on Clayton Homes’ loan portfolio being more than offset by lower interest expense due to a decline  in\\naverage borrowings and lower interest rates. Clayton Homes’ manufactured housing business continues to operate at a competitive\\ndisadvantage compared to traditional single family housing markets, which receive significant interest rate subsidies from the U.S.\\ngovernment through government agency insured mortgages. For the most part, these subsidies are not available to factory builthomes. Nevertheless, Clayton Homes remains the largest manufactured housing business in the United States and we believe that i t\\nwill continue to operate profitably, even under the prevailing conditions. \\n \\nEarnings of our furniture/transportation leasing businesses increased slightly in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 2012. T he\\nincreases primarily reflected increased lease revenues and earnings of XTRA, which benefitted from slight increases in working units\\nand average rental rates and relatively stable operating expenses.  \\nEarnings from our other finance business activities include interest and dividends from a portfolio of fixed maturity and equit y\\ninvestments, our share of the earnings of a commercial mortgage servicing business in which we own a 50% joint venture interest  and\\nearnings from a small portfolio of long-held commercial real estate loans, which were repaid in full during the third and fourt h\\nquarters of 2012. In addition, other earnings includes income from interest rate spreads charged to Clayton Homes on borrowings  by a\\nBerkshire financing subsidiary that are used to fund loans to Clayton Homes and guaranty fees charged to NetJets. Corresponding  \\nexpenses are included in Clayton Homes’ and NetJets’ results.  \\n  \\n33    First Quarter  \\n   Earnin gs  \\n   2013    2012  \\nManufactured housing and finance    $71    $40  \\nFurniture/trans portation e quipment leasin g    29     26  \\nOther     69     97  \\n              \\nPre-tax earnin gs    169     163  \\nIncome taxes and noncontrollin g interests     60     59  \\n             \\n  $109    $104  \\n      \\n       '),\n",

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   \\n  \\nInvestment and Derivative Gains/Losses  \\nA summary of investment and derivative gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments follows. \\nAmounts are in millions.  \\n  \\nPre-tax investment gains/losses in the first quarter were $590 million in 2013 and $231 million in 2012. The net gains in 2013\\nincluded $520 million related to our investments in General Electric and Goldman Sachs common stock warrants, which beginning i n\\n2013 are carried at fair value with the unrealized gain or loss included in earnings. In 2012 investment gains were primarilyattributable to sales of equity securities. \\n \\nInvestment gains/losses arise primarily from the sale or redemption of investments or when investments are carried at fair valu e\\nwith the periodic changes in fair values recorded in earnings. The timing of investment gains or losses can have a material eff ect on\\nperiodic earnings. Investment gains and losses usually have a minimal impact on the periodic changes in our consolidatedshareholders’ equity since most of our investments are regularly recorded at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses in cluded in\\nshareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. \\n \\nWe believe the amount of investment gains/losses included in earnings in any given period typically has little analytical o r\\npredictive value. Our decisions to sell securities are not motivated by the impact that the resulting gains or losses will have  on ou r\\nreported earnings. Although our management does not consider investment gains and losses in a given period as necessarily\\nmeaningful or useful in evaluating periodic earnings, we are providing information to explain the nature of such gains and loss es\\nwhen they are reflected in earnings.  \\nOther-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses in the first quarter of 2013 and 2012 were related to our investments in Texas\\nCompetitive Electric Holdings bonds. As of March 31, 2013, unrealized losses on our investments in equity and fixed maturity\\nsecurities (determined on an individual purchase lot basis) were relatively insignificant. Although we have periodically record ed\\nOTTI losses in earnings in the past, we continue to hold positions in certain of the related securities. In cases where the mar ket values\\nof these investments have increased since the dates the OTTI losses were recorded in earnings, these increases are not reflecte d in\\nearnings but are instead included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Whenrecorded, OTTI losses have no impact whatsoever on the asset values otherwise recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets or onour consolidated shareholders’ equity. In addition, the recognition of such losses in earnings rather than in accumulated othe\\nr\\ncomprehensive income does not necessarily indicate that sales are imminent or planned and sales ultimately may not occur for a\\nnumber of years. Furthermore, the recognition of OTTI losses does not necessarily indicate that the loss in value of the securi ty is\\npermanent or that the market price of the security will not subsequently increase to and ultimately exceed our original cost.  \\nDerivative gains/losses primarily represent the changes in fair value of our credit default and equity index put option contrac ts.\\nPeriodic changes in the fair values of these contracts are reflected in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatil ity o f\\nunderlying credit and equity markets. We have written essentially no new equity index put option or credit default derivative c ontracts\\nsince 2008. We have not actively traded into and out of credit default and equity index put option contract positions. Under ma ny of\\nthe remaining contracts, no settlements will occur until the contract expiration dates, which may occur many years from now.  \\nIn the first quarter, our derivative contracts generated gains of $1,206 million in 2013 and $1,002 million in 2012. In 2013, t he\\ngains were primarily attributed to changes in fair values of our equity index put option contracts while the gains in 2012 also  included\\ngains attributable to our credit default contracts.  \\n  \\n34    First Quarter  \\n   2013   2012  \\nInvestment gains/losses   $590   $231  \\nOther-than-tem porary impairment losses on investments   (85)   (337) \\nDerivative gains/losses   1,206     1,002   \\n             \\nGains/losses before income taxes and noncontrollin g interests   1,711    896  \\nIncome taxes and noncontrollin g interests   601    316  \\n        \\nNet gains/losses    $1,110   $ 580  \\n  \\n      '),\n",

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   \\n  \\nInvestment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued)  \\n  \\nIn the first quarter of 2013 and 2012, our equity index put option contracts produced gains of $1,246 million and $689 million,\\nrespectively. In 2013, the gains reflected higher equity prices and the favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements fro m\\neffects of a stronger U.S. Dollar. In 2012, the gains were due primarily to higher equity prices, partially offset by lower int erest rate\\nassumptions. Our credit default contracts generated losses of $14 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to a gain of $3 40\\nmillion in the first quarter of 2012. Our remaining credit default contract exposures associated with corporate issuers will ex pire in\\n2013 and at the end of 2013 our credit default derivative contract exposures will be limited to municipality/state issues. In 2 012, the\\ngain was primarily due to the narrowing of credit default spreads as well as the passage of time.  \\nFinancial Condition  \\nOur balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Our consolidated shareholders’ equity a t \\nMarch 31, 2013 was $198.1 billion, an increase of $10.4 billion since December 31, 2012. Consolidated cash and investments of o ur\\ninsurance and other businesses approximated $187.2 billion at March 31, 2013 including cash and cash equivalents of $44.0 billi on,\\nof which about $11.7 billion was held by the parent company. Otherwise, invested assets are held predominantly in our insurance\\nbusinesses. In January 2013, we issued $2.6 billion of parent company senior unsecured notes with maturities ranging from 2016 to\\n2043, the proceeds of which were used to fund the repayment of $2.6 billion of notes that matured in February 2013.  \\nIn September 2011, our Board of Directors authorized Berkshire Hathaway to repurchase Class A and Class B shares o f\\nBerkshire at prices no higher than a 10% premium over the book value of the shares. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Board o f\\nDirectors increased the 10% premium limitation to 20%. Berkshire may repurchase shares at management’s discretion. The repurchase program is expected to continue indefinitely, but does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any dollar amount or num be\\nr\\nof Class A or Class B shares. Repurchases will not be made if they would reduce Berkshire’s consolidated cash equivalent holdin gs \\nbelow $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire.  \\nIn the fourth quarter of 2012, we acquired 10% of the outstanding shares of Marmon held by noncontrolling interests fo r\\naggregate consideration of approximately $1.4 billion. Approximately $800 million of the consideration was paid in the fourthquarter, and the remainder was paid in March 2013. On April 29, 2013, we acquired the remaining noncontrolling interests of IMCInternational Metalworking Companies B.V., the parent company of Iscar for consideration of $2.05 billion. \\n \\nAs discussed in Note 18 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, on February 13, 2013, we committed to inves t\\n$12.12 billion in a newly formed holding company that entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire H.J. Heinz Company(“Heinz”). Our investment will consist of common and preferred stock and we will hold 50% of the voting interests in the holdin g\\ncompany. The acquisition of Heinz was approved by the Heinz shareholders on April 30, 2013. The closing will occur followingreceipt of certain regulatory approvals and the fulfillment of other customary closing conditions, and is expected to occur in the latte\\nr\\npart of the second quarter or in the third quarter of 2013. We expect to use cash on hand to fund our investments.  \\nOur railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and MidAmerican) maintain very large investments in capital\\nassets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make capital expenditures in the normal course of business. In the fi rst\\nquarter of 2013, aggregate capital expenditures of these businesses were $1.6 billion, including $891 million by MidAmerican an d\\n$732 million by BNSF. BNSF and MidAmerican forecast aggregate capital expenditures of approximately $6.6 billion over theremainder of 2013. Future capital expenditures are expected to be funded from cash flows from operations and debt issuances. InMarch 2013, BNSF issued $1.5 billion in new debentures consisting of $700 million of 3.0% debentures due in 2023 and $800\\nmillion of 4.45% debentures due in 2043. BNSF’s outstanding debt was $15.95 billion as of March 31, 2013. In the first quarter o\\nf\\n2013, MidAmerican repaid borrowings of $530 million and its aggregate outstanding borrowings were $20.9 billion as of March 31,\\n2013. BNSF and MidAmerican have aggregate debt and capital lease maturities over the remainder of 2013 of about $1.9 billion.Berkshire has committed until February 28, 2014 to provide up to $2 billion of additional capital to MidAmerican to permit therepayment of its debt obligations or to fund its regulated utility subsidiaries. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt\\nissued by BNSF, MidAmerican or any of their subsidiaries. \\n \\n  \\n35 '),\n",

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   \\n  \\nFinancial Condition (Continued)  \\n  \\nAssets of the finance and financial products businesses, which consisted primarily of loans and finance receivables, cash and\\ncash equivalents, fixed maturity investments and equity investments, were approximately $25.5 billion as of March 31, 2013 and$25.4 billion as of December 31, 2012. Liabilities were $20.7 billion as of March 31, 2013 and $22.1 billion as of December 31,2012. As of March 31, 2013, notes payable and other borrowings of finance and financial products businesses were $13.0 billion and\\nincluded approximately $11.2 billion of notes issued by Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). In January 2013, $500 \\nmillion of notes matured and BHFC issued new debt of $500 million with maturities in 2017 and 2022. Over the remainder of 2013,an additional $2.95 billion of BHFC debt will mature. We currently intend to issue additional new debt through BHFC to replacesome or all of the upcoming debt maturities. The proceeds from the BHFC notes are used to finance originated loans and acquiredloans of Clayton Homes. The full and timely payment of principal and interest on the BHFC notes is guaranteed by Berkshire. \\n \\nWe regularly access the credit markets, particularly through our railroad, utilities and energy and finance and financial produ cts\\nbusinesses. Restricted access to credit markets at affordable rates in the future could have a significant negative impact on o ur\\noperations.  \\nWe are party to several equity index put option and credit default contracts as described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financ ial\\nStatements. With limited exception, these contracts contain no collateral posting requirements under any circumstances, includi ng\\nchanges in either the fair value or intrinsic value of the contracts or a downgrade in Berkshire’s credit ratings. Substantiall y all o f \\nthese contracts were entered into prior to December 31, 2008. At March 31, 2013, the net liabilities recorded for such contract s were\\napproximately $6.7 billion and our collateral posting requirements were $10 million.  \\nOn July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law financial regulatory reform legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall \\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Reform Act”). The Reform Act reshapes financial regulations in the United State s\\nby creating new regulators, regulating new markets and market participants and providing new enforcement powers to regulators.Virtually all major areas of the Reform Act are subject to extensive rulemaking proceedings being conducted both jointly andindependently by multiple regulatory agencies, some of which have been completed and others that are expected to be finalizedduring the remainder of 2013. Although the Reform Act may adversely affect some of our business activities, it is not currentlyexpected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial results or financial condition. \\n \\nContractual Obligations  \\nWe are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to\\ncounterparties in future periods. Certain obligations reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, requ ire\\nfuture payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. The timing and/or amount of the payment  of\\nother obligations, such as losses arising from unpaid property and casualty loss insurance contracts and credit default and equ ity index\\nput option derivatives contracts, are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhapssignificantly, from the liability estimates currently recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Other obligations pertain to the\\nacquisition of goods or services in the future, which are not currently reflected in the financial statements, such as minimum rentals\\nunder operating leases. Our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2013 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those\\ndisclosed in the “Contractual Obligations” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results o\\nf\\nOperations” contained in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. Reference is also made to\\nNote 18 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\nCritical Accounting Policies  \\nWe are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to\\ncounterparties in future periods. Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments regarding transactions  that\\nhave occurred and ultimately will be settled several years in the future or concerning the recoverability of assets. Amounts re cognized\\nin the financial statements from such estimates are necessarily based on assumptions about numerous factors involving varying, and\\npossibly significant, degrees of judgment and uncertainty. Accordingly, the amounts currently recorded in the financial stateme nts\\nmay prove, with the benefit of hindsight, to be inaccurate. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Policies” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 for additional discussion regarding these estimates. \\n \\n  \\n36 '),\n",

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)   \\n  \\nCritical Accounting Policies (Continued)   \\n  \\nOur Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2013 includes estimated liabilities for unpaid losses from property and casualty\\ninsurance and reinsurance contracts of $64.3 billion. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the process of establishing loss res erve\\namounts, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage chan ge in\\nestimates of this magnitude will result in a material effect on reported earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are\\nrecorded as a component of losses incurred in the period of the change.  \\nOur Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2013 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $54.4 billion. We evaluate\\ngoodwill for impairment at least annually and conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2012. Althou gh\\nwe believe that the goodwill reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2013 is not impaired, goodwill may\\nsubsequently become impaired as a result of changes in facts and circumstances affecting the valuation of the reporting unit. A\\ngoodwill impairment charge could have a material effect on periodic net earnings.  \\nOur Consolidated Balance Sheets include significant amounts of derivative contract liabilities that are measured at fair value.  As\\nof March 31, 2013 our most significant derivative contract exposures relate to equity index put option contracts written betwee n 2004\\nand 2008. These contracts were entered into in over-the-counter markets and certain elements in the terms and conditions of suc h\\ncontracts are not standard. In particular, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts. Furthermore, the re is no\\nsource of independent data available to us showing trading volume and actual prices of completed transactions. As a result, the  values\\nof these liabilities are based on valuation models that are believed to be used by market participants. Such models or other va luation\\ntechniques may use inputs that are observable in the marketplace, while others are unobservable. Unobservable inputs require us  to\\nmake certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in establishing prices .\\nChanges in assumptions may have a significant effect on values.  \\nInformation concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial\\nStatements.  \\nForward-Looking Statements  \\nInvestors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press release s\\nand some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-looking”\\nstatements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking statements \\ninclude statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which include wor ds\\nsuch as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statemen ts \\nconcerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies o r\\nprospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are su bject\\nto risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in  which\\nwe do business, among other things. These statements are not guaranties of future performance and we have no specific intention  to\\nupdate these statements. \\n \\nActual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a \\nnumber of factors. The principal important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions t o diffe r\\nmaterially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in  fixed\\nmaturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, s uch as an\\nearthquake, hurricane or act of terrorism that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries, changes in laws or regulati ons\\naffecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries, changes in federal income tax laws, and chang es in\\ngeneral economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business.  \\n  \\n37 '),\n",

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \\nReference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report and in particular the “Market Risk Disclosures” included \\nin “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” As of March 31, 2013, there were no  \\nmaterial changes in the market risks described in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.  \\nItem 4.

Legal Proceedings  \\nWe are party in a variety of legal actions arising out of the normal course of business. In particular, such legal actions affe ct ou r\\ninsurance and reinsurance businesses.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities  \\nIn September 2011, Berkshire’s Board of Directors (“Berkshire’s Board”) approved a common stock repurchase program unde r \\nwhich Berkshire may repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices no higher than a 10% premium over the book value of theshares. In December 2012, Berkshire’s Board amended the repurchase program by raising the price limit to no higher than a 20%premium over book value. Berkshire’s Board authorization does not specify a maximum number of shares to be purchased. However,repurchases will not be made if they would reduce Berkshire’s consolidated cash equivalent holdings below $20 billion. Therepurchase program is expected to continue indefinitely and the amount of purchases will depend entirely upon the level of cashavailable, the attractiveness of investment and business opportunities either at hand or on the horizon, and the degree of disc ount fro\\nm\\nmanagement’s estimate of intrinsic value. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any dollar amount o r\\nnumber of Class A or Class B shares. There were no share repurchases in the first three months of 2013.  \\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities  \\nNone  \\nItem 4.

       "{'text': \" At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Coca-Cola companies' second-quarter earnings results conference call. Today's call is being reported. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. All participants will be on a listen-only mode until the formal question and answer portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors and therefore questions from the media will not be addressed. The participants should contact Coca-Cola's media relations department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Mr. Kim Leverage, Vice President and Vester Relations Officers. Mr. Leverage, you may now begin. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm here with James Quincy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and John Murphy, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that we've posted schedules under the Financial Information tab in the Investor section of our company website at www.cococolacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-gap financial measures which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported and are generally accepted accounting principles. I'd also like to note that you can find additional materials in the Investor section of our company website that provide the accompanying slides for today's discussion and an analysis of our margin structure. In addition, this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic FCC report. Following the prepared remarks this morning, we'll turn the call over to your questions. We recognize there may be lots of questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first in the re-intern of the queue. Now let me turn the call over to James. Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We've just closed the books on what has arguably been the toughest and most complex quarter in Coca-Cola history. And given the global pandemic, of course, this comes as no surprise. From the initial lockdowns and closures of hundreds of thousands of our customer outlets, the gradual re-opening and now another round of spikes in various countries, the impacts have been profound. In this challenging environment, we've seen some remarkable actions around the world, and I'd like to express my thanks to the countless people on the front lines who are working to improve our community's worldwide. And I'd also like to recognize my colleagues across the Coca-Cola company and our modeling system for their tireless efforts in prioritising the safety of our people, ensuring the resiliency of our supply chain, supporting our millions of customers globally and for being a force for good in their communities. As we navigated the quarter, we used a combination of focus and flexibility to manage through what we believe will be the peak levels of global lockdown. John will discuss the results in further detail, but as you think about the quarter and consider the future, I'd like to highlight the strong relationship of our performance with the intersection of two key factors. The trajectory of our business trends in the near term is closely linked to the size of our away-from-home business in any given country and the level of lockdowns in the market. For example, markets like Western Europe, which has high levels of restrictions and a meaningful away-from-home exposures, and India, which had an intense lockdown, experienced significant impacts. However, many of our Latin American markets with less restricted measures and are lower away from home presence, fair better. Further, as we went through the quarter and restrictions generally eased globally, our business saw improvements from the 25% volume declining April to the single-digit declines we are seeing now in July. The lockdowns also affected our share performance in the quarter. Our underlying performance in any RTD was positive and benefited from strong share gains in the at-home channel. However, this was entirely offset by a full point of negative channel mix due to the away-from-home pressure where we have strong shares. And as our premise begins to revive, we fully expect to return to share growth and we are already seeing sequential improvements in monthly trains. Moving forward, we are maintaining that same level of focus and flexibility that helps us navigate the quarter as we focus on winning during the reopening phases. Thankfully, at Good Starly Point matters, as a system, we went into the crisis in a strong position and the system has rallied. There is a sense of optimism about what is possible as we move forward. Importantly, we are leveraging the crisis as a catalyst to accelerate the business transformation that was already underway. And we remain guided by our purpose, which is to refresh the world and make a difference. And we are clear on how we will emerge stronger. We will win more consumers, gain share, maintain strong system economics, strengthen our impact across our stakeholders and equip our organisation to win in the future. And as we think about that future, there are two important points I'd like to make. In addition to the near-term realities of the pandemic and consumer shifts, the uncertainty around the trajectory of the macroeconomic environment is significant. We generally align with forecasts that imply the govily economy could take two to three years fully recovered. Notwithstanding the macros, our North Star is to return to pre-COVID levels and to do this ahead of the economic recovery. Second, we see the underlying structural reasons that beverages for life strategy, with the consumer at the heart of everything we do, remain essential. The commercial beverage industry will remain vibrant in the years to come. We know consumers will continue to spend more on commercial beverages and they will continue to demand greater choice. This drives the need for a broad, strong portfolio and a powerful, scaled distribution system to supply that demand. Our beverage for life vision began a transformation of the organisation supported by a refreshed culture focused on a growth mindset. We are already well on our way down this path and seeing good results. The pandemic is prompting us to move even faster. At Cagney earlier this year, we introduced the key elements of our strategy to accelerate top-right growth and maximise returns. We recognise that some elements need to evolve and others need to be pushed harder to reflect the new reality. So we are accelerating our strategy across five priorities. First, we are prioritising a portfolio that combines strong global brands, plus regional and scaled local brands to address critical age cohorts, needs dates and drink indications. Second, we are establishing a more disciplined innovation framework and a new path forward for increased marketing effectiveness and efficiency. Third, we are strengthening our RGM and execution capabilities to drive relevance and responsiveness. And to capitalise on this initiative, we are enhancing our system collaboration and capturing supply and chain efficiencies to fuel growth. And as a result, we are continuing to evolve our organisation to support accelerated strategy and invest in new capabilities to accomplish these objectives. John will discuss how we are leveraging each of these initiatives to drive improved returns and prioritise our capital allocation the most attractive opportunities. Moving to the portfolio, at the outset of the pandemic, our goal was to ruthlessly prioritise core brands and SKUs to strengthen the resilience of our supply chain. In China, we place a big emphasis on our sparking portfolio during the height of the lockdown. And as a result, the category group 14% in volume this quarter, led by trademark with strong growth in zero sugar operands. The learnings from the last several months and the insights might already accelerated SKU rationalisation has convinced us to go even deeper on this opportunity by streamlining brands. We are shifting to prioritising fewer but bigger and stronger brands across various consumminaries. At the same time, we need to do a better job nurturing and growing smaller, more enduring propositions and exiting some zombie brands, not just zombie SKUs. As a reference point, of our 400 master brands, more than half are single country brands with little canoescale. The total combined revenue of those brands is approximately 2% of our total. They are growing slower than the company average, but each one still requires resources and investment. So in the case of a brand like Holdwalla and its chilled direct store delivery, which has struggled over the last several years, we started the stock operations effective July 31. This gives us the flexibility to support our investments in brands like MinuteMade and Simply and to continue to scale rising styles like Toppatritor. Turning to Innovation of Marketing. Innovation remains critical to our beverages for life strategy and launch activity has been on the rise over several years. While this expansion of innovation has been a considerable growth driver for the Coke system, many launches fail to escape the tail and struggle to grow. We can do better. We believe the best way forward is to be more joyful and target bigger, more scalable bets and be disciplined in our experimentation. Over time, our leader, challenger and explorer brands can grow to positions that deliver scale and profitability. We are raising the bar and adding more discipline to our innovation pipeline against the fine criteria either recruiting new consumers, increasing the frequency of existing consumers and or being margin accreted. We are leading with global bets like the continued opportunity with reduced sugar offerings in brand Coke. We will also continue a high potential regional and local bets like a heart, flavoured sparkling water in the US. A heart, option, double digit, retail value share in its first 18 weeks and has even more potential given its wide appeal. With consumers prioritising health, safety and hygiene even more, there is a runway for innovation in functional benefits and contactless solutions. We will provide our prioritized innovation centres on products, packaging and equipment. Last week, for example, we announced the introduction of touchless freestyle machines in the US, which allows consumers to choose and pour drinks from their phones in just a few seconds without the need to create an account or download an app. This is an example of leveraging increased flexibility to create a solution, test it and roll it out in a few months. In addressing our marketing effects in this inefficiency, we are targeting several areas to improve how we do things. In effect, taking a fresh approach to ensure all our investments have a future role. We are increasing our focus on the cut-through quality of our messages and their alignment with in-market execution plans through purpose-driven occasion-based initiatives. The next phase of our global campaign that started with the pandemic is going live now with a large programme pair in Coca-Mill. Together, Tastes Better will kick off in the US that will be rolled out globally. Open together another holistic programme invites the world to enjoy the simple and important things in life and will also be introduced this summer across multiple media channels. These campaigns are designed to be flexible and were created for Coca-Cola teams around the world to tailor and localise their markets and platforms. Their prime examples of how driving maximum impact and reach would focus investments. Further, on the efficiency side, we are pushing on marketing ratios and reassessing our overall marketing return on investment on everything, from ad viewership across traditional media to improving effectiveness in digital. Turning to our GMM execution. Beyond these brand and innovation initiatives, we are deploying our capabilities in revenue growth management and execution to adapt to changing channel dynamics. Providing beverages people desire at a price they can afford is increasingly important, given the macroeconomic pressures could be substantial and enduring. By segmenting our markets to provide solutions to fit every budget, revenue growth management also creates opportunities to deliver value through more proximal channels and premium packages. Our GMM is not just about price, it is about offering a range of solutions to consumers at every part of the value chain and balancing profit ability to maintain and grow acclussional base. In the case of Latin America, we are moving quickly to increase our refillable offerings to address affordability. At the same time in Japan, we are working to decouple the 500 ml coke offering to a larger and smaller pack options to help drive both transactions and enhance our revenue per case. Beyond our GM, we are working with our modeling partners to improve execution by addressing changing channel dynamics and supporting our customers via through periods of elevated demand like we've seen in grocery and modern trades or the lockdown-related challenges we're seeing in on-premise stores. In Europe, we're launching a new campaign open like never before, as it means to support on-premise re-opening as well as smaller, independent outlets and at home occasions. In the US, we've helped over 300,000 of our food service outlets manage through the lockdown and now we're there to help them get back and be stronger than ever through initiatives like our rapid response resource. We are continuing to invest heavily in executing digital strategies to drive sales, efficiencies and data analytics across our business. We recently appointed a global VP of Offline to Online Digital Transformation to work closely with leaders across the system to unify and scale our e-commerce and digital strategies. We're aggressively going off of the omnichannel opportunity with the Consumer at the Centre. Partnering with a large e-commerce platform in China, we increased our system revenue through that customer by 65% during the recent 618 festival, the largest mid-year shopping festival in China. Our partnerships with third-party aggregators are driving incidents as consumers quickly migrate to mobile delivery for groceries and prepared meals. For instance, working with large restaurant delivery intermediaries in North America, we added value bundles to over 4,500 restaurant menus in the quarter. We're also accelerating our B2B platforms to streamline the value chain with modern trade. In the US, we've added more than 8,000 outlets to the micro digitised ordering platform just this quarter, allowing a contactless relationship with our customers. Finally, we're experimenting with direct consumer by expanding platforms like Coco Cola and Tuowar throughout Latin America. This web-based solution delivers to homes as quickly as the next day and currently enjoys 1 million household users at a healthy double-digit growth rate. To execute these initiatives with speed and effectiveness, we work closely with our borrowing partners through the crisis. The connectivity across the system has been extraordinary. In the last few months, we've held global and regional system meetings with leadership, allowing us to accomplish even more than we thought possible. We will continue this increased engagement and sharing of best practices with our partners from top to bottom, post-pandemic, as we recognise the opportunity to collaborate even more closely across the supply chain and to leverage active global scale. Ultimately, we aspire to grow faster system-wide and deliver stronger results that will enable us to continue investing and putting our purpose into action. Then, if the organisation. Since we set out on the beverages for life journey, we have evolved our organisation every step of the way and we continue to do so to ensure structure follows strategy. To focus on a growth portfolio of profitable brands with quality leadership positions that is supported by an efficient and effective marketing model, we need to be flexible. Our system is continuing to move further away from a complicated three-dimensional organisation structure to more of a network model, improving our agility and maximising scale. As the pandemic acts as a catalyst to accelerate our strategy, our organisation is moving into the future faster too and we must set up properly to empower our system to win. This will require us to reallocate people resources and could mean some reductions due to our evolving approach. There is no doubt that we face significant pressures in the second quarter. We exited the quarter with promising signs that the most challenging period is indeed behind us in much of the world. There is still a lot of work to do. There is no doubt the world will be different below the crisis. In many ways the future is coming out as faster than ever. We are embracing the changes and pivoting our business to take advantage of new opportunities. We are poised as a system to accelerate our transformation to return to driving growth in years to come. The more I hand the call over to John, I'd like to take a moment to comment on the social justice movements that has significant impacts around the world. Let me be clear, as the answer is, there is no place, racism or institutionalising the quality of the world. We are taking an active approach and focusing our efforts on listening, leading, investing and advocating. We are engaging stakeholders, employees and other business leaders and we have core social media for the time being while we review our policies to ensure a high level of accountability and transparency. We recently committed to spend an incremental $500 million with black-owned suppliers and are actively contributing to communities on this important issue. With that, John will discuss our results and provide more details on how we plan the drive returns as our increased focus provides the flexibility we need. Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to spend my time this morning focused on three things. One, some commentary on the quarter and the rest of your outlook. Two, thoughts on the broader and longer term implications to value creation for our company and our system. And finally, on our capital allocation priorities. As expected, our second quarter was one with significant hurdles to overcome. As lockdown and social distancing requirements placed profound pressures on our customers and consumers. In the second quarter volumes were down 16% driven by declines in higher revenue per case away from home channels. Organic revenues declined 26% driven by a 22% decline in concentrate chippance and a 4% decline in price mix. The gap between concentrate chippance and unit cases this quarter is attributable to cycling the timing of chippance from last year, primarily in Amia and Latin America, along with rationalization of stock levels after some safety stock building in the first quarter. The majority of the price mix pressure during the quarter was driven by segment mix from meaningful declines in our cost of business in global ventures as well as bottling investments. Underline gross margin was down approximately 300 basis points, primarily driven by volume declines in capital intensive finish goods businesses like Costa, food service in North America and our bottling investments. In addition to negative package and channel mix pressure. Despite the significant pressure of top line and gross margin, in addition to currency headwinds comparable operating margins were only slightly lower than last year given the effective management of our SGNA expenses. While we had a considerable amount of leverage during the quarter from cost management, part of it is attributable to timing due to modifying our full year marketing spend forecast which included an adjustment from the first quarter. As we look to the remainder of the year, we will continue to hold off and providing full year guidance given the amount of uncertainty that remains. That said, there are some factors work highlighting as you think about the second half. While we believe the second quarter will be the severely impetus, we do expect the top line trajectory to continue to correlate closely to the level of mobility of consumers and the health of the away from home channels as James discussed earlier. The pandemic is not behind us. There is still good reason to be cautious as global COVID infections continue to increase with case growth generally shifting from developed to emerging markets. While we are seeing sequential improvement, recovery will likely not to be linear. Some markets that we're recovering are having a second spike in cases like we're seeing in Iran, Australia, Romania and here in the United States. Depending on the trajectory of recovery in away from home, channel and package makes will continue to put pressure on our gross margin. At the same time, while we do expect continued cost savings in the back half, the amount of leverage should moderate as we look to accelerate our marketing investments given improving ROI characteristics in a number of markets. I also add that if the top line improves faster than expectations, we are prepared to reinvest more aggressively to further strengthen our position heading into 2021. And finally, moving to below the line, in an effort to extend the duration of our outstanding debt, in the first half, we issued 11 and a half billion dollars of long-term material, resulting in higher interest expense. While we firmly believe this is the right thing to do longer term, you will continue to see a year over a year increase in interest expense in the back half of the year. James laid out the approach we are taking on the portfolio, innovation, marketing, execution and system efficiencies to return our company to top line growth at the high end of our growth algorithm. We believe strongly in our future being propelled by top line growth, but we also appreciate the top line must ultimately create value that meets or exceeds our shareholder expectations. To this end, we are focused on the following critical objectives. First, we are defining even more sharply the optimal shape of our P&L and balances. We have developed a clear mission, strategic drivers and financial expectations for each of our business segments, and have set objectives to improve margins and free cash flow across the board. We leverage these improved returns and invest what is needed to fund continued growth while ensuring our balance needs remain fit for purpose for our future needs. Second, opportunities abound to cultivate more efficient growth. As James discussed earlier, we are moving with speed to optimize marketing spend consolidated behind our growth portfolio and business segment priorities. Using our productivity mindset, we are continuing to uncover cost saving opportunities across the supply chain and operating expenses. By the hallmark of our business is winning locally with our consumers and customers, we continue to see opportunities to scale several services across the system through unlocks energies. In addition, as we evolve the organization to follow the strategy, this too will drive better resource allocation. As James mentioned, our global system will continue to collaborate as our strategy accelerates and evolves, and together we are working to be nimbler to sustain the growth that follows. As we pursue these objectives, our capital allocation priorities remain the same. Reinvest for appropriates in the business to drive momentum and continue to grow the dividend returning cash to our shareholders. M&A and Share Repurchase are unlikely to play a prominent role in the near term. Our balance sheet is strong and we remain confident in our liquidity position as we continue to navigate through the crisis. As we work with the system to manage through the current challenges caused by COVID-19, our botters are not immune to the effects of the business disruption. That said, approximately 80% of our business, volumetrically, is in the hands of our top 15 botters. Our run through our botling investment group. The remaining 20% are small to mid-sized. Our large public botters are well managed companies with healthy balance sheets. Nearly all of our small to mid-sized botters are in a stable position and taking proactive steps on efficient working capital management, expenses and capital to manage the situation. As we close the books on the second quarter, there is no doubt that this has been a challenging time for the Coca-Cola system. Throughout our system has remained focused on the journey ahead, pivoting and adapting to ensure that we accelerate our transformation, allowing our system to emerge stronger. With that operator, we are ready to take questions. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. To ask a question, you will need to press star one on your telephone to withdraw your question, press the pound key. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have any additional questions, you may be joining the queue. Thank you. Our first question comes from Brian Spilling with Bank of America. Please go ahead to your line. It's not open. Hi, thank you. Good morning, everyone. My question is just around the balance between efficiency and growth. We've come a long way in the last couple of years to exit last year to be at the top end of the revenue growth algorithm. I guess now we're contemplating trying to get back to that level, but at the same time with a focus on efficiency. James, maybe if you could talk a little bit about organizationally, how you're just going to balance trying to achieve both of those things at the same time. Yeah, thanks, Frank. Look, clearly we've got to do both. If we just aim for top line growth, we, I'm sure, will get back up to the top end of the algorithm where we were for the last few years. But if we do that without focusing on efficiency, that's not going to work for the company or work for the body, or work for the shareholders. And the inverse is true. If we just stop worrying about the top line of focus on efficiency, we'll do well for a year or two, but then the wheels will come off. We've got to do both. And the way we're going to approach it is to really attack the priorities we've talked about. In the good years, the pre-COVID years, we got up to the top end of the revenue growth thing. We were doing a lot of innovation, we were curating a lot of brands. We knew we had things that were working really well, and other brands that were struggling. And as we were at the top end of the growth, of course, you see that you need to not just remove those on BSKUs, but prune down some of the explorer brands that you can refocus on those with most potential. When times are going, well, you set a certain pace for that sort of activity. And now in the COVID times, and in these more impaired economic times, at least for the near future, we need to accelerate that. So that's why we said, look, we need to let's really bring forward the agenda, which every wave of innovation generates. You diverge, and then you need to converge on the best products, the best products. Let's accelerate that. Let's get really focused. That will also allow us to get more focused and more efficient on how we do the marketing and where we direct the marketing investment. So the two things will work together to both be more able to drive the top line, because or more able to get back to the sort of growth rates we want for the top line, and be able to win new consumers and win share in the marketplace, and yet do so in a more efficient way. We've also seen over the last number of years, as we've moved to platform services, as we've evolved our organization, we can see that we had things that were ahead of us that could also be done, and we're going to accelerate those. Not just as a company, but we're looking for ways as a system, for how can we build on some of the great collaboration that already exists, like the cross enterprise procurement group, where we buy collectively our core inputs, our core commodities, how can we take that to the next level? So we're really looking for the really to build on the learnings of the pre-covid. We knew we had things that would have to be done. Let's accelerate those so that we can generate the efficiencies that will both fuel the growth and get in the top line back up and allow us a bridge in terms of resources given that revenue is still impacted in the near term. So it's got to be done, and we're going to the last thought to do that is, is really it's going to build on the cultural work we've done in recent years to focus on a growth mindset. We've got to keep pushing that idea and keep looking what's working and take the resources from the brands and the ideas and the projects that aren't working, and funnel them back to those with the most opportunities. So it's really an end-to-end idea from the consumer back was through to the structure and the culture of the organization. So that actually you end up with an agenda is not just a mix of two things strategy, growth and efficiently, but actually each of those components is necessary and enables the other. Your next question comes from the line of the Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Great, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping that you touched a bit of course on revenue growth management, but I think that's an area where we've all been, I think, well educated on revenue growth management as a great tool to drive growth and in what's called roughly economic expansion. And then, you know, in an economic downturn, still probably a bit less explored. The price mix performance in Latin America and I think you highlighted Mexico in particular in the press release was really notable. So if you could talk a little bit about where you are in terms of implementing revenue growth management strategies to benefit you or to help support the business in a downturn, is Mexico simply a lead market and there's much more to come on that front, but you know, additional color there I think could be helpful. Thanks. Sure, sure, Lauren. Yeah, I mean interestingly, the whole approach for revenue growth management certainly in one of its early iterations at the company with the border actually came at times of economic difficulty, particularly in Latin America. So it is an approach that is a capability, a way of doing things that is just as useful in the good times as it is in the bad times. And so what you see as a flying that capability, which the company together with the bottles have spent the last few years refreshing, it's now being directed at the new challenges. And as you say, whereas we might have been putting more emphasis on using it to develop the premium opportunities in the last few years, we're going to have to have to use it to focus on some of the affordability opportunities. Examples of those, you know, is really, for example in Mexico, but also places like Brazil and a number of others really focusing down on refillable packaging. The benefit of refillable packaging in the context of RGM is of course, you can the economic allow you to offer the product that are lower price points. So we can really connect to what is likely to be some economic stress on disposable income and therefore the need for affordable products for refillables. And that's that works in Latin America, that works in Africa, that works in a number of different places. But it also can, as a capability, RGM can work in countries like Japan. In Japan, we sell a lot of half-liter P-T bottles for something like Coke. And in this current environment, what we're going to do is try and split that up. So have one slightly bigger package, one slightly smaller package, the smaller package obviously will allow us to offer a lower price point. And the slightly bigger package will be a sharing package which will offer, you know, more advantage per liter. And so we can really use this capability to come in and adapt the portfolio, not just in the emerging markets, but also in the developed markets. Knowing that yes, there will still be people looking for premium products and stock up. But there are also people on the lot of disposable income pressure. And there the number one objective, at least in the beverage category for us, is to bring down the entry price point. What's the lowest price at which you can buy a Coke? Your next question comes from the line of Dera Moussinian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Hey, good morning, guys. Just taking a step back, obviously the June and July to date, unit case volume trends show a significant sequential improvement versus April and May. Do you feel like you have enough visibility that it's reasonable at this point to generally expect sequential progress from those July numbers as we look at the balance of the year and the remainder of the back half? I know you obviously won't give us a specific number, but you know, more conceptually perhaps you could touch on that. And that's a global question, but within that answer, I was hoping you could parse out thoughts by region a bit more. I'd imagine the answer may be very different in Asia and Europe versus the US and Latin America, just given the relative differences we're seeing in sequential COVID case counts. Sure, I think the simple answer is no. And by no what I mean is there are too many to use the famous run spells, little framework. There are too many known unknowns ahead of us. Because while yes, we have seen sequential improvement through the second quarter and into the beginning of July in all geographies, all major geographies around the world. The principle unknown is the degree of lockdown going forward. As we talked about in the second quarter, the biggest variables affecting the business were one, the degree of lockdown and two, the degree of away from home business in that country with the lockdown. And the simple fact remains that while things have got better undoubtedly July, July, June, June, June, was better than May, May was better than April. The reality remains that the virus is not completely under control. There have been countries which have repeated lockdowns or cities and states within countries that have repeated lockdowns. And so honestly, I think we could, if we saw the virus starting to be under control, we would imagine yes, we would see sequential improvement through the months and quarters going forward. But we cannot discount, there might be further waves of lockdowns, partial or poor. Having said that, I am pretty confident that the second quarter will ultimately prove to have been the most difficult and the most impacted quarter. Principally because I think the governments are getting smarter about how they apply public health measures and get things under control, such that we are unlikely to see the whole world entering a lockdown at the same point in time. I am not sure that completely helps, but unfortunately that is the outlook we see with a strong degree of uncertainty. Here next question comes from the line of McModie with RBC. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Yeah, thanks good morning everyone. Maybe I could just take another spin on Dares question and ask specifically on areas where we've seen the virus kind of come back. So you think about Australia, parts of Hong Kong, Texas, etc. James, I mean it's very helpful on understanding kind of the July trends, but things have been moving so quickly. Perhaps you can talk about maybe what you're seeing or just give us some context on some of those markets just so we can get a better understanding of how things have shaped since the end of June. Sure, I mean, look, the I think the fairest thing would be to say that those markets where we've seen a repeat lockdowns, they have never or they have not yet gone down at the same sort of degree they went down in the first round of their lockdown, whether that be February, March or April. And on a global basis, obviously April was the most difficult month. So we are not seeing that round two is as bad as round one. I think that if you take somewhere like Japan, which started off with lockdown and they opened up a bit then they locked down again. Yeah, the number started getting negative again, but they weren't really as bad as they had been at the initial stage. So you do get a bit of a weekly line. So you can't that's why I made the point on Dares question. You can't assume, not that unnecessary thing you were, you can't assume it was a straight line from where we are now to good. I think there's going to be some variations as you start to look across the months. But the second ways have not yet looked as bad as the first waves, whether I look across any of the countries you really mentioned or some of the other ones. Your next question comes from the line of Rob Autonstein with Evercours. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Great. Thank you very much. James, I'd like to focus on the chart that you had on the 400 master brands with 50% accounting for 98% of revenue and 50% just 2% of revenue. And I know this is a very big question that you could probably talk about for a long time, but kind of high level. What do you think the right mix is and how do you get to that right mix? Presumably there were certain incentives, relationships with the botlers that got you where you are now. How do you see that evolving over time? And what do you think the financial impact will be when you get to a more optimal mix? Thank you. Sure. I'm not sure there's a destination where there's one right number of the mix between leaders, challenges and explorers. And we will always have a tail of smaller brands. That's not the issue that we're after. And actually it would probably be a sign of weakness to have no smaller brands in the portfolio because it would mean we're not nurturing the future. We're not nurturing the explorers that will be challenges that will be leaders in the future. What we want to see is steady pipeline of progression of creating ever stronger brands have real quality leadership. Obviously they got to pass through the challenges phase. And therefore you've got to launch a whole series of explorers, small brands to try and get that knowing that most of them will not make it. What we're looking at here is that we have not been assertive enough and directive enough weeding out the explorers that have not worked and are unlikely to work so that we can redirect the resources onto the explorers and the challenges that have the most opportunity into the future. So it's not a question of a certain number of explorers are right or wrong. It's a question of are they succeeding or not? And I think we talked to the investors that success criteria for explorers is very fast growth and starting to gain a core of very engaged and loyal consumers and that you're really starting to make ways in the category even though small and that the success criteria for Challenger was being able to gain enough market share that over time you could believe you were going to get to leadership because that leadership you have both scale and disproportionately more favorable economic than margin versus the other two categories. So what we're looking at here is in a way the result of lots of experimentation, the exploration which is a good thing but we're looking at an incomplete task of weeding out the ones that work and so what we're looking at particularly in a large bucket of smaller brands is they stay small for some good period of time and they're not growing so they're not meeting the success criteria for saying there as an explorer brand and that's true across all categories. I mean our objective remains to create a broad portfolio of leaders across all sorts of categories and so really we're just accelerating the work that we needed to happen on all those explorer brands that were not meeting our own success criteria of they were going somewhere they were growing etc and that will allow us to redirect resources for those that are the best position to grow so again we'll be fueling top line growth more efficiently allowing us to get back to where we were in 2019 and emerged stronger ahead of the pack with with better margins for our system. Your next question comes from the line of seed powers with Deutsche Bank please go ahead your line is now open. Yes hi everyone good morning. I got a question from you on capital location. John you're pretty clear on the priorities and the near term deemphasis on M&A and share of purchase but the implication there is that you have high confidence in your ability to both you know reinvest steadily in the business and also continue to maintain even grow the dividend whereas the market's been increasingly concerned about your ability to do just that in recent weeks and months so can you maybe expand on what drives your confidence there and is there any set of circumstances that you can envision in the near to medium term that might you know better challenge your ability to defend the dividend again given the precedence that healthy business reinvestment takes in your prioritization. Thanks. I think Steve first and foremost I think the decisions on capital allocation we take into account not just the short term but also taking a view as to where we think the business will be over the next couple of years and as we as we look at that even though as James said there are a number of known unknowns we I think you got to divide the calendar into into a few parts one is what's happening in here and now number two is the sort of the length and shape of the recovery and then number three is getting back to some degree of what people have I think calling a new normal so we've got tremendous confidence in the in the beverage industry in in general we think that the fundamentals for growth going forward longer term remain remain the same I'll be as with the the challenges in the in the near term and we think that we can and we'll get back to the high end or long term growth algorithm over time and so with that context we're we're comfortable in maintaining our position around our capital allocation priorities first and foremost continuing to support the business as we go forward in terms of capital and marketing investments and then number two continuing to support the dividend in that period wrapped around that of course is our is our overall debt strategy we are confident with the decisions we've taken here today that the balance sheet is strong enough to withhold the the near term pressures and and we're while we make goals slightly outside of our of our range this year we see that being been a short term blip so so I'll also say you know we're confident in the industry in our ability to emerge stronger and and with that in mind the the priorities that we lay out we think are are achievable obviously as James there's there are lots of kind of known unknowns and and if we continue to review and adapt as those unknowns become become more known your next question comes from the line of the low-row and ground day with Fuganhai please go ahead you're buying a small pen yes good morning everyone James I'm I too for this my question on the Ampere's channel can you please embellen the Ampere's performance and trend so what are you seeing in TSRs this is pressure dining contract cutters all sports conservators the news of travel trying to figure out in the pace of the recovery by those subchannels I did fair to assume that the piece that is recovery the fastest like TSR is for the most profitable thank you um sure I'll I'll try and add a little bit of texture on this one for you but the first to bear in mind is the predominant effect is the degree of lockdown in the country as it relates to those channels so there there isn't really a way to describe the global trends by those different channels because it very much depended or does depend still on what source of measures governments have put in place to for for health reasons and so there's there the global trend is not really that meaningful I would just urge you to look more at the degree of lockdown on the total business if we take one country and look at what we see as to have happened there and take the US which the one you're probably most familiar with if we look at the the away from home channels first point to know is there was sequential improvement as we went from April to May to June and so things got better clearly the the the biggest determinants of how a channel did was what percent of its business needed people to be inside the building so you mentioned QSR actually QSR was one of the in aggregates in the US was at the better end of the impact why because many of them have well developed drive-through and digitally enabled take away businesses so actually they weren't they they're not only improved but they were not the most affected of the eating away channels the chance the source of channels that were most impacted by the lockdowns were bars full service restaurants at work locations some of these places where where simply for there was no foot traffic and so the declines were were were significant and given that many offices are still not going back for working if if at all for example at work remains one of the most affected channels much more so than than QSR or other casual dining or even bars and restaurants so the simplest way to think about or to analyze the away from home channels is simply to look at the degrees the restrictions in place at any moment in time and how that affects their business vis-à-vis do they have take away or business that can leave the location and to what extent is they dependent fully on people being in the location. Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Hersard with Goldman Sachs please go ahead your line is now open. Good morning. I actually had a question on the ramping of your marketing spend in the second half as it sounds like you know you've started to accelerate spending ahead of the recovery so I really wanted to you know understand how quickly you expect this spending to impact the top line you know given there's you know typically a leg and then I assume there will be a bigger drag on your margins from the step that's spending the second half but you know maybe clarify that and then maybe highlight any offsets you might have or levers you can pull to minimize the impact from this thanks. Thanks Bonnie let me take that one again as I mentioned the air I think I think it's important to to kind of divide the calendar up you know for the second quarter we did take a significant step back from marketing because we didn't think it was going to be that effective and as we look to the second half of the year I think the name of the game is to stay flexible and and be able to adapt as quickly as possible with that in mind as we as we see the the shape of the recovery taking place around the world there are opportunities to to step up to step back up our investment levels and I think there's also an opportunity to use this time to completely rethink the amount of investment and markets actually needs in an optimal level going forward so so that's that's very much a a key priority for the second half of the year in terms of of specific numbers I don't I don't have specific numbers to provide because I think it's you know it's again going back to what I said about being flexible it's a function of being able to adapt and react as markets demonstrate the trajectory that they're that they're on but as we as we go forward and as we go into the into 2021 you know a key a key priority is to is to emerge stronger as James alluded to earlier and to emerge stronger faster and so with that in mind it's it's it's a key objective in the second half of the year is to position ourselves well for 2021 and particularly in the markets that are really important to us and the markets where the competitive the competitive pressures are strongest so so stepping up on a on a case by case basis in the second half of the year and being ready for 21 and for sure as I said in the in the script as we as we look into the second half of the year you're not going to potentially see the same cost efficiencies that draws the sort of the operation operating margin impact in the second quarter in the in the second half of the year as we as we continue to look at at our at our marketing needs and take decisions according to your next question comes from the line of bill chat all of the centrists please go ahead your line is now open hey thanks good morning hey James I just wanted to you know step back trying to understand like how we should look at the the slide deck the announcements today because I mean on one side you can say look we're trying to be more nimble we're trying to be stronger coming out the other side you can say look earnings don't matter this year they might not really matter this year let's don't waste a good crisis let's step up all our spending and move forward and and we can really accelerate everything over the next year and if it's a ladder then you know you didn't really talk about kind of how much this is going to cost and whether it's going to impact this year and next year in terms of cost so maybe a little more color on which which way it is and and what you're expecting to stand I'm not sure whether you were referring as much to DME or any additional cost because we're changing approach but let me let me try a couple of things and then see whether it answers the question we firstly let me just hold on the line what John said you know we are going to be good stewards of our capital and yeah of course we could just pile on the marketing spend because you know inverted commerce no one cares about the earnings this year yeah but that still comes from a bottom line and our capital available and you know if you look if you ignore calendar years and just think about the business why would I want to spend money in a period if I can't get the return particularly if there's long lockdown so we don't take an approach of overly thinking in the calendar years when it comes to marketing we're about generating momentum for the brands and the business and as John said if we see opportunities to invest and generate and accelerate the top line growth that's what we're going to do which is which is the inverse of what we saw in the second quarter we thought no no marketing is going to make much difference in the second quarter so we pull back we pull back heavily and then you know we'll have to gauge and be adaptable as we work through the uncertainty in these no and unknowns as to where are which countries and which categories versus which lockdowns is going to make sense to spend so we are going to be judicious in our use of marketing in our use of capital expenditure we much as you can see the sales trend improving through the quarter of the life our expectation is that the general direction of travel is sequential improvement therefore we expect to come back and spend more marketing but we're going to be focused on getting that right but said more generally you know if we're going to emerge stronger we need to get the business back to the right level of investment to drive the top line growth that's what's going to create the profit growth for the Coca-Cola company and that that is going to go behind the revamped approach the portfolio the revamped approach the how we continue to do marketing you know if we do have to let go of some brands potentially even ones with acquired like old Walla we may need to take some charges and you know even that wouldn't affect the cash flow because we're using it we perhaps we've converted the brands for something else or maybe it wasn't making any money but there might have to be some some charges obviously our intent would be to make those decisions as quickly as possible and recognize them as soon as their night I hope that provides something of color to your question your next question comes from the line of Andrea Texera with JP Morgan please go ahead your line is now open thank you good morning so I wonder if you can elaborate more on the efficiency and ROI commentary that you guys just made if you can see a pretty margins in fact already the third quarter year or more of a fourth quarter aspiration and a clarification on Jones comments about capital location is that any room to accelerate the divestures of the bottling investment that is done so far and become even more alive to repurpose the funds into dividends and buybacks thank you so on thanks Andrea on the second question you know there's as we've talked in previous calls I think we have a very a very open open book with respect to the balance sheet and right sizing and optimizing the balance sheet as we go forward and and there's no there's no investment on the balance sheet that does not get a regular review and determination as to whether it should still be there with respect to that part of the decision making our bottling investment group is an important piece of the equation we don't have a timetable for further refranchising but it certainly is our longer term goals to be more acid light just as we have I think stays on on previous occasions and I've actually accordingly with with previous refranchising efforts so that will and continues to be a part of the agenda but not a specific timeline on us and that was respect to the the comments on operating margins I don't I don't have a clear number to give you for either Q3 or Q4 but it goes without saying is that as we as we look at the opportunities that present themselves we're not necessarily as focused on the months or more focused on building momentum for the business and sustaining it in the particularly in the markets that have got outsized importance to us so we make those decisions as they as they come and as they appear to be the right ones to make at the right time and the consequences will flow through accordingly. Your next question comes from the line of Carlos Laboy with HSBC please go ahead your line is metal pin. Yes good morning everyone you know big sparkling declines in India, Western Europe and Fountain in the US have have deep structural changes such as heavy client turnover in any of those three situations prompted you to move toward a reset of the model in those three business. Carlos no I don't I don't think one I would describe any of those as a deep structural change that has driven some sort of reset of the model again a very very link to the degree of lockdown that have been mandated because of COVID and you know if you just take that three both I mean fountain of food service and on-premise in the US and a lot of a mere particularly Western Europe has a lot of away from home business the outlets were shut and what we found is that as the outlet starts to open the business starts to flourish again and and India simply put there isn't a modern trade as you'd understand it in the developed markets at a large scale and so when they had a lockdown it locked down all the small stores and so you know literally the whole whole marketplace was closed down at that point in time in what would have been peak season in India so it's it's really locked down related and and I think as they come off you'll see the re-opening you know we are social creatures as humans and we like experiences people will want to go out and that there will be you know habits that will have changed but we will go out and experience the world and these channels will bounce back. John? Here next. Yeah James just if I could just add to that I think Carlos I think what we will see both in some of the developing markets like India and even here in the United States is I think there will be a higher turnover particularly of small customers in both the in both the sort of more modern away from home as well as the traditional away from home so I think we expect to see that but that in and of itself I don't think means a structural reset is necessary it just means there will be more more new ones coming along and and for our system it just it'll be a key area of focus as we as we come out of the recovery period. Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grenade Jeffries please go ahead your line this is not open. Hey good morning everyone and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to come back to investment levels we talked about this a couple of different prior questions but I think differently and really focused on North America and my question isn't so much about Canadians but really more about adequacy. In the context being that your key competitor has committed to supporting its brands this is on the fields of stuff that investment levels last year they're not trying to hit an external earnings number market series increasing focus if I'm not mistaken it's also a bigger part of executive comp and then of course the snacks out of the businesses thriving which gives them some flexibility to lean in on beverages so setting aside the COVID related pressures can you comment on what you're seeing competitively in North America John I think you commented a moment ago that there's also willingness internally to co-include a company before doing sort of profit targets to lean in and make sure that you're adequately reinvested in key markets presented in the US with the inclusion that maybe just can confirm it and then maybe talk a little bit about some of the governors and key metrics that you guys are looking at brand equity markets here absolute levels of an M-sending to ensure that your brands are indeed adequately supported and that you don't end up credit into your end and looking at the next year following sure that you're under invested. Thank you. I'm going to go John. So I'll go ahead. I'll start then you jump in. You know clearly we are gone I mean we've set a North Star emerged stronger which is gain more engaging more consumers, gain more drinkers, gain share and a reestablish system economics for us and the ballroom system. So that is where we're headed and and very clearly said we're gone if we have to choose between investing and not investing and making more money but damaging the top line we're going to invest the driver's top line. The the fundamental of the co-system work when we can get back to where we were pre-crisis which was the top end of the growth algorithm on the top line and that then flows through with the leverage into the bottle. So that is going to be the North Star globally and in North America we need to make sure that happens and clearly we're going to do that in a flexible way that John talked about with having said that we fully expect to be spending sequentially more DME in North America in Q3 and and in Q4 obviously you know we have a we have key metrics by brands as to what we expect from each brand and what they're doing and going for that and and what what we see in the market places again a bit like the total volume performance in terms of share what we see is that where where where the world is open we've been able to gain share the predominant negative effect is channel mix and it's worth remembering that our we have half as much again market share in a way from home channels as we have in at home channels. So the closing of the way from home of course makes a negative impact to our market share. So what we're focusing on is in the channels that are open let's focus on gaining share where where the world is still working knowing that as the re-opening occur and being you know social humans will go out for the experiences that we will structurally gain share in in channels and then will be favored as those the where we have historically been stronger stock of re-opening. So that's that's our approach overall and in North America. Please and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincy for an closing remarks. Thank you everyone. So to to sum up we're using the the current moment of the pandemic as an opportunity to accelerate the implementation of our strategies with a portfolio of strong brands, a focus on high impact market innovation and a structure that fits the strategy we are confident that our system will emerge stronger from this crisis and returns to living good growth for the years to come. As always we thank you for your interest your investment in our company and for joining us today. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\",\n",

      " At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Coca-Cola companies' second-quarter earnings results conference call. Today's call is being reported. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. All participants will be on a listen-only mode until the formal question and answer portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors and therefore questions from the media will not be addressed. The participants should contact Coca-Cola's media relations department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Mr. Kim Leverage, Vice President and Vester Relations Officers. Mr. Leverage, you may now begin. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm here with James Quincy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and John Murphy, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that we've posted schedules under the Financial Information tab in the Investor section of our company website at www.cococolacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-gap financial measures which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported and are generally accepted accounting principles. I'd also like to note that you can find additional materials in the Investor section of our company website that provide the accompanying slides for today's discussion and an analysis of our margin structure. In addition, this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic FCC report. Following the prepared remarks this morning, we'll turn the call over to your questions. We recognize there may be lots of questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first in the re-intern of the queue. Now let me turn the call over to James. Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We've just closed the books on what has arguably been the toughest and most complex quarter in Coca-Cola history. And given the global pandemic, of course, this comes as no surprise. From the initial lockdowns and closures of hundreds of thousands of our customer outlets, the gradual re-opening and now another round of spikes in various countries, the impacts have been profound. In this challenging environment, we've seen some remarkable actions around the world, and I'd like to express my thanks to the countless people on the front lines who are working to improve our community's worldwide. And I'd also like to recognize my colleagues across the Coca-Cola company and our modeling system for their tireless efforts in prioritising the safety of our people, ensuring the resiliency of our supply chain, supporting our millions of customers globally and for being a force for good in their communities. As we navigated the quarter, we used a combination of focus and flexibility to manage through what we believe will be the peak levels of global lockdown. John will discuss the results in further detail, but as you think about the quarter and consider the future, I'd like to highlight the strong relationship of our performance with the intersection of two key factors. The trajectory of our business trends in the near term is closely linked to the size of our away-from-home business in any given country and the level of lockdowns in the market. For example, markets like Western Europe, which has high levels of restrictions and a meaningful away-from-home exposures, and India, which had an intense lockdown, experienced significant impacts. However, many of our Latin American markets with less restricted measures and are lower away from home presence, fair better. Further, as we went through the quarter and restrictions generally eased globally, our business saw improvements from the 25% volume declining April to the single-digit declines we are seeing now in July. The lockdowns also affected our share performance in the quarter. Our underlying performance in any RTD was positive and benefited from strong share gains in the at-home channel. However, this was entirely offset by a full point of negative channel mix due to the away-from-home pressure where we have strong shares. And as our premise begins to revive, we fully expect to return to share growth and we are already seeing sequential improvements in monthly trains. Moving forward, we are maintaining that same level of focus and flexibility that helps us navigate the quarter as we focus on winning during the reopening phases. Thankfully, at Good Starly Point matters, as a system, we went into the crisis in a strong position and the system has rallied. There is a sense of optimism about what is possible as we move forward. Importantly, we are leveraging the crisis as a catalyst to accelerate the business transformation that was already underway. And we remain guided by our purpose, which is to refresh the world and make a difference. And we are clear on how we will emerge stronger. We will win more consumers, gain share, maintain strong system economics, strengthen our impact across our stakeholders and equip our organisation to win in the future. And as we think about that future, there are two important points I'd like to make. In addition to the near-term realities of the pandemic and consumer shifts, the uncertainty around the trajectory of the macroeconomic environment is significant. We generally align with forecasts that imply the govily economy could take two to three years fully recovered. Notwithstanding the macros, our North Star is to return to pre-COVID levels and to do this ahead of the economic recovery. Second, we see the underlying structural reasons that beverages for life strategy, with the consumer at the heart of everything we do, remain essential. The commercial beverage industry will remain vibrant in the years to come. We know consumers will continue to spend more on commercial beverages and they will continue to demand greater choice. This drives the need for a broad, strong portfolio and a powerful, scaled distribution system to supply that demand. Our beverage for life vision began a transformation of the organisation supported by a refreshed culture focused on a growth mindset. We are already well on our way down this path and seeing good results. The pandemic is prompting us to move even faster. At Cagney earlier this year, we introduced the key elements of our strategy to accelerate top-right growth and maximise returns. We recognise that some elements need to evolve and others need to be pushed harder to reflect the new reality. So we are accelerating our strategy across five priorities. First, we are prioritising a portfolio that combines strong global brands, plus regional and scaled local brands to address critical age cohorts, needs dates and drink indications. Second, we are establishing a more disciplined innovation framework and a new path forward for increased marketing effectiveness and efficiency. Third, we are strengthening our RGM and execution capabilities to drive relevance and responsiveness. And to capitalise on this initiative, we are enhancing our system collaboration and capturing supply and chain efficiencies to fuel growth. And as a result, we are continuing to evolve our organisation to support accelerated strategy and invest in new capabilities to accomplish these objectives. John will discuss how we are leveraging each of these initiatives to drive improved returns and prioritise our capital allocation the most attractive opportunities. Moving to the portfolio, at the outset of the pandemic, our goal was to ruthlessly prioritise core brands and SKUs to strengthen the resilience of our supply chain. In China, we place a big emphasis on our sparking portfolio during the height of the lockdown. And as a result, the category group 14% in volume this quarter, led by trademark with strong growth in zero sugar operands. The learnings from the last several months and the insights might already accelerated SKU rationalisation has convinced us to go even deeper on this opportunity by streamlining brands. We are shifting to prioritising fewer but bigger and stronger brands across various consumminaries. At the same time, we need to do a better job nurturing and growing smaller, more enduring propositions and exiting some zombie brands, not just zombie SKUs. As a reference point, of our 400 master brands, more than half are single country brands with little canoescale. The total combined revenue of those brands is approximately 2% of our total. They are growing slower than the company average, but each one still requires resources and investment. So in the case of a brand like Holdwalla and its chilled direct store delivery, which has struggled over the last several years, we started the stock operations effective July 31. This gives us the flexibility to support our investments in brands like MinuteMade and Simply and to continue to scale rising styles like Toppatritor. Turning to Innovation of Marketing. Innovation remains critical to our beverages for life strategy and launch activity has been on the rise over several years. While this expansion of innovation has been a considerable growth driver for the Coke system, many launches fail to escape the tail and struggle to grow. We can do better. We believe the best way forward is to be more joyful and target bigger, more scalable bets and be disciplined in our experimentation. Over time, our leader, challenger and explorer brands can grow to positions that deliver scale and profitability. We are raising the bar and adding more discipline to our innovation pipeline against the fine criteria either recruiting new consumers, increasing the frequency of existing consumers and or being margin accreted. We are leading with global bets like the continued opportunity with reduced sugar offerings in brand Coke. We will also continue a high potential regional and local bets like a heart, flavoured sparkling water in the US. A heart, option, double digit, retail value share in its first 18 weeks and has even more potential given its wide appeal. With consumers prioritising health, safety and hygiene even more, there is a runway for innovation in functional benefits and contactless solutions. We will provide our prioritized innovation centres on products, packaging and equipment. Last week, for example, we announced the introduction of touchless freestyle machines in the US, which allows consumers to choose and pour drinks from their phones in just a few seconds without the need to create an account or download an app. This is an example of leveraging increased flexibility to create a solution, test it and roll it out in a few months. In addressing our marketing effects in this inefficiency, we are targeting several areas to improve how we do things. In effect, taking a fresh approach to ensure all our investments have a future role. We are increasing our focus on the cut-through quality of our messages and their alignment with in-market execution plans through purpose-driven occasion-based initiatives. The next phase of our global campaign that started with the pandemic is going live now with a large programme pair in Coca-Mill. Together, Tastes Better will kick off in the US that will be rolled out globally. Open together another holistic programme invites the world to enjoy the simple and important things in life and will also be introduced this summer across multiple media channels. These campaigns are designed to be flexible and were created for Coca-Cola teams around the world to tailor and localise their markets and platforms. Their prime examples of how driving maximum impact and reach would focus investments. Further, on the efficiency side, we are pushing on marketing ratios and reassessing our overall marketing return on investment on everything, from ad viewership across traditional media to improving effectiveness in digital. Turning to our GMM execution. Beyond these brand and innovation initiatives, we are deploying our capabilities in revenue growth management and execution to adapt to changing channel dynamics. Providing beverages people desire at a price they can afford is increasingly important, given the macroeconomic pressures could be substantial and enduring. By segmenting our markets to provide solutions to fit every budget, revenue growth management also creates opportunities to deliver value through more proximal channels and premium packages. Our GMM is not just about price, it is about offering a range of solutions to consumers at every part of the value chain and balancing profit ability to maintain and grow acclussional base. In the case of Latin America, we are moving quickly to increase our refillable offerings to address affordability. At the same time in Japan, we are working to decouple the 500 ml coke offering to a larger and smaller pack options to help drive both transactions and enhance our revenue per case. Beyond our GM, we are working with our modeling partners to improve execution by addressing changing channel dynamics and supporting our customers via through periods of elevated demand like we've seen in grocery and modern trades or the lockdown-related challenges we're seeing in on-premise stores. In Europe, we're launching a new campaign open like never before, as it means to support on-premise re-opening as well as smaller, independent outlets and at home occasions. In the US, we've helped over 300,000 of our food service outlets manage through the lockdown and now we're there to help them get back and be stronger than ever through initiatives like our rapid response resource. We are continuing to invest heavily in executing digital strategies to drive sales, efficiencies and data analytics across our business. We recently appointed a global VP of Offline to Online Digital Transformation to work closely with leaders across the system to unify and scale our e-commerce and digital strategies. We're aggressively going off of the omnichannel opportunity with the Consumer at the Centre. Partnering with a large e-commerce platform in China, we increased our system revenue through that customer by 65% during the recent 618 festival, the largest mid-year shopping festival in China. Our partnerships with third-party aggregators are driving incidents as consumers quickly migrate to mobile delivery for groceries and prepared meals. For instance, working with large restaurant delivery intermediaries in North America, we added value bundles to over 4,500 restaurant menus in the quarter. We're also accelerating our B2B platforms to streamline the value chain with modern trade. In the US, we've added more than 8,000 outlets to the micro digitised ordering platform just this quarter, allowing a contactless relationship with our customers. Finally, we're experimenting with direct consumer by expanding platforms like Coco Cola and Tuowar throughout Latin America. This web-based solution delivers to homes as quickly as the next day and currently enjoys 1 million household users at a healthy double-digit growth rate. To execute these initiatives with speed and effectiveness, we work closely with our borrowing partners through the crisis. The connectivity across the system has been extraordinary. In the last few months, we've held global and regional system meetings with leadership, allowing us to accomplish even more than we thought possible. We will continue this increased engagement and sharing of best practices with our partners from top to bottom, post-pandemic, as we recognise the opportunity to collaborate even more closely across the supply chain and to leverage active global scale. Ultimately, we aspire to grow faster system-wide and deliver stronger results that will enable us to continue investing and putting our purpose into action. Then, if the organisation. Since we set out on the beverages for life journey, we have evolved our organisation every step of the way and we continue to do so to ensure structure follows strategy. To focus on a growth portfolio of profitable brands with quality leadership positions that is supported by an efficient and effective marketing model, we need to be flexible. Our system is continuing to move further away from a complicated three-dimensional organisation structure to more of a network model, improving our agility and maximising scale. As the pandemic acts as a catalyst to accelerate our strategy, our organisation is moving into the future faster too and we must set up properly to empower our system to win. This will require us to reallocate people resources and could mean some reductions due to our evolving approach. There is no doubt that we face significant pressures in the second quarter. We exited the quarter with promising signs that the most challenging period is indeed behind us in much of the world. There is still a lot of work to do. There is no doubt the world will be different below the crisis. In many ways the future is coming out as faster than ever. We are embracing the changes and pivoting our business to take advantage of new opportunities. We are poised as a system to accelerate our transformation to return to driving growth in years to come. The more I hand the call over to John, I'd like to take a moment to comment on the social justice movements that has significant impacts around the world. Let me be clear, as the answer is, there is no place, racism or institutionalising the quality of the world. We are taking an active approach and focusing our efforts on listening, leading, investing and advocating. We are engaging stakeholders, employees and other business leaders and we have core social media for the time being while we review our policies to ensure a high level of accountability and transparency. We recently committed to spend an incremental $500 million with black-owned suppliers and are actively contributing to communities on this important issue. With that, John will discuss our results and provide more details on how we plan the drive returns as our increased focus provides the flexibility we need. Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to spend my time this morning focused on three things. One, some commentary on the quarter and the rest of your outlook. Two, thoughts on the broader and longer term implications to value creation for our company and our system. And finally, on our capital allocation priorities. As expected, our second quarter was one with significant hurdles to overcome. As lockdown and social distancing requirements placed profound pressures on our customers and consumers. In the second quarter volumes were down 16% driven by declines in higher revenue per case away from home channels. Organic revenues declined 26% driven by a 22% decline in concentrate chippance and a 4% decline in price mix. The gap between concentrate chippance and unit cases this quarter is attributable to cycling the timing of chippance from last year, primarily in Amia and Latin America, along with rationalization of stock levels after some safety stock building in the first quarter. The majority of the price mix pressure during the quarter was driven by segment mix from meaningful declines in our cost of business in global ventures as well as bottling investments. Underline gross margin was down approximately 300 basis points, primarily driven by volume declines in capital intensive finish goods businesses like Costa, food service in North America and our bottling investments. In addition to negative package and channel mix pressure. Despite the significant pressure of top line and gross margin, in addition to currency headwinds comparable operating margins were only slightly lower than last year given the effective management of our SGNA expenses. While we had a considerable amount of leverage during the quarter from cost management, part of it is attributable to timing due to modifying our full year marketing spend forecast which included an adjustment from the first quarter. As we look to the remainder of the year, we will continue to hold off and providing full year guidance given the amount of uncertainty that remains. That said, there are some factors work highlighting as you think about the second half. While we believe the second quarter will be the severely impetus, we do expect the top line trajectory to continue to correlate closely to the level of mobility of consumers and the health of the away from home channels as James discussed earlier. The pandemic is not behind us. There is still good reason to be cautious as global COVID infections continue to increase with case growth generally shifting from developed to emerging markets. While we are seeing sequential improvement, recovery will likely not to be linear. Some markets that we're recovering are having a second spike in cases like we're seeing in Iran, Australia, Romania and here in the United States. Depending on the trajectory of recovery in away from home, channel and package makes will continue to put pressure on our gross margin. At the same time, while we do expect continued cost savings in the back half, the amount of leverage should moderate as we look to accelerate our marketing investments given improving ROI characteristics in a number of markets. I also add that if the top line improves faster than expectations, we are prepared to reinvest more aggressively to further strengthen our position heading into 2021. And finally, moving to below the line, in an effort to extend the duration of our outstanding debt, in the first half, we issued 11 and a half billion dollars of long-term material, resulting in higher interest expense. While we firmly believe this is the right thing to do longer term, you will continue to see a year over a year increase in interest expense in the back half of the year. James laid out the approach we are taking on the portfolio, innovation, marketing, execution and system efficiencies to return our company to top line growth at the high end of our growth algorithm. We believe strongly in our future being propelled by top line growth, but we also appreciate the top line must ultimately create value that meets or exceeds our shareholder expectations. To this end, we are focused on the following critical objectives. First, we are defining even more sharply the optimal shape of our P&L and balances. We have developed a clear mission, strategic drivers and financial expectations for each of our business segments, and have set objectives to improve margins and free cash flow across the board. We leverage these improved returns and invest what is needed to fund continued growth while ensuring our balance needs remain fit for purpose for our future needs. Second, opportunities abound to cultivate more efficient growth. As James discussed earlier, we are moving with speed to optimize marketing spend consolidated behind our growth portfolio and business segment priorities. Using our productivity mindset, we are continuing to uncover cost saving opportunities across the supply chain and operating expenses. By the hallmark of our business is winning locally with our consumers and customers, we continue to see opportunities to scale several services across the system through unlocks energies. In addition, as we evolve the organization to follow the strategy, this too will drive better resource allocation. As James mentioned, our global system will continue to collaborate as our strategy accelerates and evolves, and together we are working to be nimbler to sustain the growth that follows. As we pursue these objectives, our capital allocation priorities remain the same. Reinvest for appropriates in the business to drive momentum and continue to grow the dividend returning cash to our shareholders. M&A and Share Repurchase are unlikely to play a prominent role in the near term. Our balance sheet is strong and we remain confident in our liquidity position as we continue to navigate through the crisis. As we work with the system to manage through the current challenges caused by COVID-19, our botters are not immune to the effects of the business disruption. That said, approximately 80% of our business, volumetrically, is in the hands of our top 15 botters. Our run through our botling investment group. The remaining 20% are small to mid-sized. Our large public botters are well managed companies with healthy balance sheets. Nearly all of our small to mid-sized botters are in a stable position and taking proactive steps on efficient working capital management, expenses and capital to manage the situation. As we close the books on the second quarter, there is no doubt that this has been a challenging time for the Coca-Cola system. Throughout our system has remained focused on the journey ahead, pivoting and adapting to ensure that we accelerate our transformation, allowing our system to emerge stronger. With that operator, we are ready to take questions. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. To ask a question, you will need to press star one on your telephone to withdraw your question, press the pound key. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have any additional questions, you may be joining the queue. Thank you. Our first question comes from Brian Spilling with Bank of America. Please go ahead to your line. It's not open. Hi, thank you. Good morning, everyone. My question is just around the balance between efficiency and growth. We've come a long way in the last couple of years to exit last year to be at the top end of the revenue growth algorithm. I guess now we're contemplating trying to get back to that level, but at the same time with a focus on efficiency. James, maybe if you could talk a little bit about organizationally, how you're just going to balance trying to achieve both of those things at the same time. Yeah, thanks, Frank. Look, clearly we've got to do both. If we just aim for top line growth, we, I'm sure, will get back up to the top end of the algorithm where we were for the last few years. But if we do that without focusing on efficiency, that's not going to work for the company or work for the body, or work for the shareholders. And the inverse is true. If we just stop worrying about the top line of focus on efficiency, we'll do well for a year or two, but then the wheels will come off. We've got to do both. And the way we're going to approach it is to really attack the priorities we've talked about. In the good years, the pre-COVID years, we got up to the top end of the revenue growth thing. We were doing a lot of innovation, we were curating a lot of brands. We knew we had things that were working really well, and other brands that were struggling. And as we were at the top end of the growth, of course, you see that you need to not just remove those on BSKUs, but prune down some of the explorer brands that you can refocus on those with most potential. When times are going, well, you set a certain pace for that sort of activity. And now in the COVID times, and in these more impaired economic times, at least for the near future, we need to accelerate that. So that's why we said, look, we need to let's really bring forward the agenda, which every wave of innovation generates. You diverge, and then you need to converge on the best products, the best products. Let's accelerate that. Let's get really focused. That will also allow us to get more focused and more efficient on how we do the marketing and where we direct the marketing investment. So the two things will work together to both be more able to drive the top line, because or more able to get back to the sort of growth rates we want for the top line, and be able to win new consumers and win share in the marketplace, and yet do so in a more efficient way. We've also seen over the last number of years, as we've moved to platform services, as we've evolved our organization, we can see that we had things that were ahead of us that could also be done, and we're going to accelerate those. Not just as a company, but we're looking for ways as a system, for how can we build on some of the great collaboration that already exists, like the cross enterprise procurement group, where we buy collectively our core inputs, our core commodities, how can we take that to the next level? So we're really looking for the really to build on the learnings of the pre-covid. We knew we had things that would have to be done. Let's accelerate those so that we can generate the efficiencies that will both fuel the growth and get in the top line back up and allow us a bridge in terms of resources given that revenue is still impacted in the near term. So it's got to be done, and we're going to the last thought to do that is, is really it's going to build on the cultural work we've done in recent years to focus on a growth mindset. We've got to keep pushing that idea and keep looking what's working and take the resources from the brands and the ideas and the projects that aren't working, and funnel them back to those with the most opportunities. So it's really an end-to-end idea from the consumer back was through to the structure and the culture of the organization. So that actually you end up with an agenda is not just a mix of two things strategy, growth and efficiently, but actually each of those components is necessary and enables the other. Your next question comes from the line of the Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Great, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping that you touched a bit of course on revenue growth management, but I think that's an area where we've all been, I think, well educated on revenue growth management as a great tool to drive growth and in what's called roughly economic expansion. And then, you know, in an economic downturn, still probably a bit less explored. The price mix performance in Latin America and I think you highlighted Mexico in particular in the press release was really notable. So if you could talk a little bit about where you are in terms of implementing revenue growth management strategies to benefit you or to help support the business in a downturn, is Mexico simply a lead market and there's much more to come on that front, but you know, additional color there I think could be helpful. Thanks. Sure, sure, Lauren. Yeah, I mean interestingly, the whole approach for revenue growth management certainly in one of its early iterations at the company with the border actually came at times of economic difficulty, particularly in Latin America. So it is an approach that is a capability, a way of doing things that is just as useful in the good times as it is in the bad times. And so what you see as a flying that capability, which the company together with the bottles have spent the last few years refreshing, it's now being directed at the new challenges. And as you say, whereas we might have been putting more emphasis on using it to develop the premium opportunities in the last few years, we're going to have to have to use it to focus on some of the affordability opportunities. Examples of those, you know, is really, for example in Mexico, but also places like Brazil and a number of others really focusing down on refillable packaging. The benefit of refillable packaging in the context of RGM is of course, you can the economic allow you to offer the product that are lower price points. So we can really connect to what is likely to be some economic stress on disposable income and therefore the need for affordable products for refillables. And that's that works in Latin America, that works in Africa, that works in a number of different places. But it also can, as a capability, RGM can work in countries like Japan. In Japan, we sell a lot of half-liter P-T bottles for something like Coke. And in this current environment, what we're going to do is try and split that up. So have one slightly bigger package, one slightly smaller package, the smaller package obviously will allow us to offer a lower price point. And the slightly bigger package will be a sharing package which will offer, you know, more advantage per liter. And so we can really use this capability to come in and adapt the portfolio, not just in the emerging markets, but also in the developed markets. Knowing that yes, there will still be people looking for premium products and stock up. But there are also people on the lot of disposable income pressure. And there the number one objective, at least in the beverage category for us, is to bring down the entry price point. What's the lowest price at which you can buy a Coke? Your next question comes from the line of Dera Moussinian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Hey, good morning, guys. Just taking a step back, obviously the June and July to date, unit case volume trends show a significant sequential improvement versus April and May. Do you feel like you have enough visibility that it's reasonable at this point to generally expect sequential progress from those July numbers as we look at the balance of the year and the remainder of the back half? I know you obviously won't give us a specific number, but you know, more conceptually perhaps you could touch on that. And that's a global question, but within that answer, I was hoping you could parse out thoughts by region a bit more. I'd imagine the answer may be very different in Asia and Europe versus the US and Latin America, just given the relative differences we're seeing in sequential COVID case counts. Sure, I think the simple answer is no. And by no what I mean is there are too many to use the famous run spells, little framework. There are too many known unknowns ahead of us. Because while yes, we have seen sequential improvement through the second quarter and into the beginning of July in all geographies, all major geographies around the world. The principle unknown is the degree of lockdown going forward. As we talked about in the second quarter, the biggest variables affecting the business were one, the degree of lockdown and two, the degree of away from home business in that country with the lockdown. And the simple fact remains that while things have got better undoubtedly July, July, June, June, June, was better than May, May was better than April. The reality remains that the virus is not completely under control. There have been countries which have repeated lockdowns or cities and states within countries that have repeated lockdowns. And so honestly, I think we could, if we saw the virus starting to be under control, we would imagine yes, we would see sequential improvement through the months and quarters going forward. But we cannot discount, there might be further waves of lockdowns, partial or poor. Having said that, I am pretty confident that the second quarter will ultimately prove to have been the most difficult and the most impacted quarter. Principally because I think the governments are getting smarter about how they apply public health measures and get things under control, such that we are unlikely to see the whole world entering a lockdown at the same point in time. I am not sure that completely helps, but unfortunately that is the outlook we see with a strong degree of uncertainty. Here next question comes from the line of McModie with RBC. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Yeah, thanks good morning everyone. Maybe I could just take another spin on Dares question and ask specifically on areas where we've seen the virus kind of come back. So you think about Australia, parts of Hong Kong, Texas, etc. James, I mean it's very helpful on understanding kind of the July trends, but things have been moving so quickly. Perhaps you can talk about maybe what you're seeing or just give us some context on some of those markets just so we can get a better understanding of how things have shaped since the end of June. Sure, I mean, look, the I think the fairest thing would be to say that those markets where we've seen a repeat lockdowns, they have never or they have not yet gone down at the same sort of degree they went down in the first round of their lockdown, whether that be February, March or April. And on a global basis, obviously April was the most difficult month. So we are not seeing that round two is as bad as round one. I think that if you take somewhere like Japan, which started off with lockdown and they opened up a bit then they locked down again. Yeah, the number started getting negative again, but they weren't really as bad as they had been at the initial stage. So you do get a bit of a weekly line. So you can't that's why I made the point on Dares question. You can't assume, not that unnecessary thing you were, you can't assume it was a straight line from where we are now to good. I think there's going to be some variations as you start to look across the months. But the second ways have not yet looked as bad as the first waves, whether I look across any of the countries you really mentioned or some of the other ones. Your next question comes from the line of Rob Autonstein with Evercours. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Great. Thank you very much. James, I'd like to focus on the chart that you had on the 400 master brands with 50% accounting for 98% of revenue and 50% just 2% of revenue. And I know this is a very big question that you could probably talk about for a long time, but kind of high level. What do you think the right mix is and how do you get to that right mix? Presumably there were certain incentives, relationships with the botlers that got you where you are now. How do you see that evolving over time? And what do you think the financial impact will be when you get to a more optimal mix? Thank you. Sure. I'm not sure there's a destination where there's one right number of the mix between leaders, challenges and explorers. And we will always have a tail of smaller brands. That's not the issue that we're after. And actually it would probably be a sign of weakness to have no smaller brands in the portfolio because it would mean we're not nurturing the future. We're not nurturing the explorers that will be challenges that will be leaders in the future. What we want to see is steady pipeline of progression of creating ever stronger brands have real quality leadership. Obviously they got to pass through the challenges phase. And therefore you've got to launch a whole series of explorers, small brands to try and get that knowing that most of them will not make it. What we're looking at here is that we have not been assertive enough and directive enough weeding out the explorers that have not worked and are unlikely to work so that we can redirect the resources onto the explorers and the challenges that have the most opportunity into the future. So it's not a question of a certain number of explorers are right or wrong. It's a question of are they succeeding or not? And I think we talked to the investors that success criteria for explorers is very fast growth and starting to gain a core of very engaged and loyal consumers and that you're really starting to make ways in the category even though small and that the success criteria for Challenger was being able to gain enough market share that over time you could believe you were going to get to leadership because that leadership you have both scale and disproportionately more favorable economic than margin versus the other two categories. So what we're looking at here is in a way the result of lots of experimentation, the exploration which is a good thing but we're looking at an incomplete task of weeding out the ones that work and so what we're looking at particularly in a large bucket of smaller brands is they stay small for some good period of time and they're not growing so they're not meeting the success criteria for saying there as an explorer brand and that's true across all categories. I mean our objective remains to create a broad portfolio of leaders across all sorts of categories and so really we're just accelerating the work that we needed to happen on all those explorer brands that were not meeting our own success criteria of they were going somewhere they were growing etc and that will allow us to redirect resources for those that are the best position to grow so again we'll be fueling top line growth more efficiently allowing us to get back to where we were in 2019 and emerged stronger ahead of the pack with with better margins for our system. Your next question comes from the line of seed powers with Deutsche Bank please go ahead your line is now open. Yes hi everyone good morning. I got a question from you on capital location. John you're pretty clear on the priorities and the near term deemphasis on M&A and share of purchase but the implication there is that you have high confidence in your ability to both you know reinvest steadily in the business and also continue to maintain even grow the dividend whereas the market's been increasingly concerned about your ability to do just that in recent weeks and months so can you maybe expand on what drives your confidence there and is there any set of circumstances that you can envision in the near to medium term that might you know better challenge your ability to defend the dividend again given the precedence that healthy business reinvestment takes in your prioritization. Thanks. I think Steve first and foremost I think the decisions on capital allocation we take into account not just the short term but also taking a view as to where we think the business will be over the next couple of years and as we as we look at that even though as James said there are a number of known unknowns we I think you got to divide the calendar into into a few parts one is what's happening in here and now number two is the sort of the length and shape of the recovery and then number three is getting back to some degree of what people have I think calling a new normal so we've got tremendous confidence in the in the beverage industry in in general we think that the fundamentals for growth going forward longer term remain remain the same I'll be as with the the challenges in the in the near term and we think that we can and we'll get back to the high end or long term growth algorithm over time and so with that context we're we're comfortable in maintaining our position around our capital allocation priorities first and foremost continuing to support the business as we go forward in terms of capital and marketing investments and then number two continuing to support the dividend in that period wrapped around that of course is our is our overall debt strategy we are confident with the decisions we've taken here today that the balance sheet is strong enough to withhold the the near term pressures and and we're while we make goals slightly outside of our of our range this year we see that being been a short term blip so so I'll also say you know we're confident in the industry in our ability to emerge stronger and and with that in mind the the priorities that we lay out we think are are achievable obviously as James there's there are lots of kind of known unknowns and and if we continue to review and adapt as those unknowns become become more known your next question comes from the line of the low-row and ground day with Fuganhai please go ahead you're buying a small pen yes good morning everyone James I'm I too for this my question on the Ampere's channel can you please embellen the Ampere's performance and trend so what are you seeing in TSRs this is pressure dining contract cutters all sports conservators the news of travel trying to figure out in the pace of the recovery by those subchannels I did fair to assume that the piece that is recovery the fastest like TSR is for the most profitable thank you um sure I'll I'll try and add a little bit of texture on this one for you but the first to bear in mind is the predominant effect is the degree of lockdown in the country as it relates to those channels so there there isn't really a way to describe the global trends by those different channels because it very much depended or does depend still on what source of measures governments have put in place to for for health reasons and so there's there the global trend is not really that meaningful I would just urge you to look more at the degree of lockdown on the total business if we take one country and look at what we see as to have happened there and take the US which the one you're probably most familiar with if we look at the the away from home channels first point to know is there was sequential improvement as we went from April to May to June and so things got better clearly the the the biggest determinants of how a channel did was what percent of its business needed people to be inside the building so you mentioned QSR actually QSR was one of the in aggregates in the US was at the better end of the impact why because many of them have well developed drive-through and digitally enabled take away businesses so actually they weren't they they're not only improved but they were not the most affected of the eating away channels the chance the source of channels that were most impacted by the lockdowns were bars full service restaurants at work locations some of these places where where simply for there was no foot traffic and so the declines were were were significant and given that many offices are still not going back for working if if at all for example at work remains one of the most affected channels much more so than than QSR or other casual dining or even bars and restaurants so the simplest way to think about or to analyze the away from home channels is simply to look at the degrees the restrictions in place at any moment in time and how that affects their business vis-à-vis do they have take away or business that can leave the location and to what extent is they dependent fully on people being in the location. Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Hersard with Goldman Sachs please go ahead your line is now open. Good morning. I actually had a question on the ramping of your marketing spend in the second half as it sounds like you know you've started to accelerate spending ahead of the recovery so I really wanted to you know understand how quickly you expect this spending to impact the top line you know given there's you know typically a leg and then I assume there will be a bigger drag on your margins from the step that's spending the second half but you know maybe clarify that and then maybe highlight any offsets you might have or levers you can pull to minimize the impact from this thanks. Thanks Bonnie let me take that one again as I mentioned the air I think I think it's important to to kind of divide the calendar up you know for the second quarter we did take a significant step back from marketing because we didn't think it was going to be that effective and as we look to the second half of the year I think the name of the game is to stay flexible and and be able to adapt as quickly as possible with that in mind as we as we see the the shape of the recovery taking place around the world there are opportunities to to step up to step back up our investment levels and I think there's also an opportunity to use this time to completely rethink the amount of investment and markets actually needs in an optimal level going forward so so that's that's very much a a key priority for the second half of the year in terms of of specific numbers I don't I don't have specific numbers to provide because I think it's you know it's again going back to what I said about being flexible it's a function of being able to adapt and react as markets demonstrate the trajectory that they're that they're on but as we as we go forward and as we go into the into 2021 you know a key a key priority is to is to emerge stronger as James alluded to earlier and to emerge stronger faster and so with that in mind it's it's it's a key objective in the second half of the year is to position ourselves well for 2021 and particularly in the markets that are really important to us and the markets where the competitive the competitive pressures are strongest so so stepping up on a on a case by case basis in the second half of the year and being ready for 21 and for sure as I said in the in the script as we as we look into the second half of the year you're not going to potentially see the same cost efficiencies that draws the sort of the operation operating margin impact in the second quarter in the in the second half of the year as we as we continue to look at at our at our marketing needs and take decisions according to your next question comes from the line of bill chat all of the centrists please go ahead your line is now open hey thanks good morning hey James I just wanted to you know step back trying to understand like how we should look at the the slide deck the announcements today because I mean on one side you can say look we're trying to be more nimble we're trying to be stronger coming out the other side you can say look earnings don't matter this year they might not really matter this year let's don't waste a good crisis let's step up all our spending and move forward and and we can really accelerate everything over the next year and if it's a ladder then you know you didn't really talk about kind of how much this is going to cost and whether it's going to impact this year and next year in terms of cost so maybe a little more color on which which way it is and and what you're expecting to stand I'm not sure whether you were referring as much to DME or any additional cost because we're changing approach but let me let me try a couple of things and then see whether it answers the question we firstly let me just hold on the line what John said you know we are going to be good stewards of our capital and yeah of course we could just pile on the marketing spend because you know inverted commerce no one cares about the earnings this year yeah but that still comes from a bottom line and our capital available and you know if you look if you ignore calendar years and just think about the business why would I want to spend money in a period if I can't get the return particularly if there's long lockdown so we don't take an approach of overly thinking in the calendar years when it comes to marketing we're about generating momentum for the brands and the business and as John said if we see opportunities to invest and generate and accelerate the top line growth that's what we're going to do which is which is the inverse of what we saw in the second quarter we thought no no marketing is going to make much difference in the second quarter so we pull back we pull back heavily and then you know we'll have to gauge and be adaptable as we work through the uncertainty in these no and unknowns as to where are which countries and which categories versus which lockdowns is going to make sense to spend so we are going to be judicious in our use of marketing in our use of capital expenditure we much as you can see the sales trend improving through the quarter of the life our expectation is that the general direction of travel is sequential improvement therefore we expect to come back and spend more marketing but we're going to be focused on getting that right but said more generally you know if we're going to emerge stronger we need to get the business back to the right level of investment to drive the top line growth that's what's going to create the profit growth for the Coca-Cola company and that that is going to go behind the revamped approach the portfolio the revamped approach the how we continue to do marketing you know if we do have to let go of some brands potentially even ones with acquired like old Walla we may need to take some charges and you know even that wouldn't affect the cash flow because we're using it we perhaps we've converted the brands for something else or maybe it wasn't making any money but there might have to be some some charges obviously our intent would be to make those decisions as quickly as possible and recognize them as soon as their night I hope that provides something of color to your question your next question comes from the line of Andrea Texera with JP Morgan please go ahead your line is now open thank you good morning so I wonder if you can elaborate more on the efficiency and ROI commentary that you guys just made if you can see a pretty margins in fact already the third quarter year or more of a fourth quarter aspiration and a clarification on Jones comments about capital location is that any room to accelerate the divestures of the bottling investment that is done so far and become even more alive to repurpose the funds into dividends and buybacks thank you so on thanks Andrea on the second question you know there's as we've talked in previous calls I think we have a very a very open open book with respect to the balance sheet and right sizing and optimizing the balance sheet as we go forward and and there's no there's no investment on the balance sheet that does not get a regular review and determination as to whether it should still be there with respect to that part of the decision making our bottling investment group is an important piece of the equation we don't have a timetable for further refranchising but it certainly is our longer term goals to be more acid light just as we have I think stays on on previous occasions and I've actually accordingly with with previous refranchising efforts so that will and continues to be a part of the agenda but not a specific timeline on us and that was respect to the the comments on operating margins I don't I don't have a clear number to give you for either Q3 or Q4 but it goes without saying is that as we as we look at the opportunities that present themselves we're not necessarily as focused on the months or more focused on building momentum for the business and sustaining it in the particularly in the markets that have got outsized importance to us so we make those decisions as they as they come and as they appear to be the right ones to make at the right time and the consequences will flow through accordingly. Your next question comes from the line of Carlos Laboy with HSBC please go ahead your line is metal pin. Yes good morning everyone you know big sparkling declines in India, Western Europe and Fountain in the US have have deep structural changes such as heavy client turnover in any of those three situations prompted you to move toward a reset of the model in those three business. Carlos no I don't I don't think one I would describe any of those as a deep structural change that has driven some sort of reset of the model again a very very link to the degree of lockdown that have been mandated because of COVID and you know if you just take that three both I mean fountain of food service and on-premise in the US and a lot of a mere particularly Western Europe has a lot of away from home business the outlets were shut and what we found is that as the outlet starts to open the business starts to flourish again and and India simply put there isn't a modern trade as you'd understand it in the developed markets at a large scale and so when they had a lockdown it locked down all the small stores and so you know literally the whole whole marketplace was closed down at that point in time in what would have been peak season in India so it's it's really locked down related and and I think as they come off you'll see the re-opening you know we are social creatures as humans and we like experiences people will want to go out and that there will be you know habits that will have changed but we will go out and experience the world and these channels will bounce back. John? Here next. Yeah James just if I could just add to that I think Carlos I think what we will see both in some of the developing markets like India and even here in the United States is I think there will be a higher turnover particularly of small customers in both the in both the sort of more modern away from home as well as the traditional away from home so I think we expect to see that but that in and of itself I don't think means a structural reset is necessary it just means there will be more more new ones coming along and and for our system it just it'll be a key area of focus as we as we come out of the recovery period. Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grenade Jeffries please go ahead your line this is not open. Hey good morning everyone and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to come back to investment levels we talked about this a couple of different prior questions but I think differently and really focused on North America and my question isn't so much about Canadians but really more about adequacy. In the context being that your key competitor has committed to supporting its brands this is on the fields of stuff that investment levels last year they're not trying to hit an external earnings number market series increasing focus if I'm not mistaken it's also a bigger part of executive comp and then of course the snacks out of the businesses thriving which gives them some flexibility to lean in on beverages so setting aside the COVID related pressures can you comment on what you're seeing competitively in North America John I think you commented a moment ago that there's also willingness internally to co-include a company before doing sort of profit targets to lean in and make sure that you're adequately reinvested in key markets presented in the US with the inclusion that maybe just can confirm it and then maybe talk a little bit about some of the governors and key metrics that you guys are looking at brand equity markets here absolute levels of an M-sending to ensure that your brands are indeed adequately supported and that you don't end up credit into your end and looking at the next year following sure that you're under invested. Thank you. I'm going to go John. So I'll go ahead. I'll start then you jump in. You know clearly we are gone I mean we've set a North Star emerged stronger which is gain more engaging more consumers, gain more drinkers, gain share and a reestablish system economics for us and the ballroom system. So that is where we're headed and and very clearly said we're gone if we have to choose between investing and not investing and making more money but damaging the top line we're going to invest the driver's top line. The the fundamental of the co-system work when we can get back to where we were pre-crisis which was the top end of the growth algorithm on the top line and that then flows through with the leverage into the bottle. So that is going to be the North Star globally and in North America we need to make sure that happens and clearly we're going to do that in a flexible way that John talked about with having said that we fully expect to be spending sequentially more DME in North America in Q3 and and in Q4 obviously you know we have a we have key metrics by brands as to what we expect from each brand and what they're doing and going for that and and what what we see in the market places again a bit like the total volume performance in terms of share what we see is that where where where the world is open we've been able to gain share the predominant negative effect is channel mix and it's worth remembering that our we have half as much again market share in a way from home channels as we have in at home channels. So the closing of the way from home of course makes a negative impact to our market share. So what we're focusing on is in the channels that are open let's focus on gaining share where where the world is still working knowing that as the re-opening occur and being you know social humans will go out for the experiences that we will structurally gain share in in channels and then will be favored as those the where we have historically been stronger stock of re-opening. So that's that's our approach overall and in North America. Please and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincy for an closing remarks. Thank you everyone. So to to sum up we're using the the current moment of the pandemic as an opportunity to accelerate the implementation of our strategies with a portfolio of strong brands, a focus on high impact market innovation and a structure that fits the strategy we are confident that our system will emerge stronger from this crisis and returns to living good growth for the years to come. As always we thank you for your interest your investment in our company and for joining us today. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\n"
